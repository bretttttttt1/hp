THE SECOND TASK

You said you’d already worked out that egg clue!” said
Hermione indignantly.
“Keep your voice down!” said Harry crossly. “I just need to —
sort of fine-tune it, all right?”
He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the
Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be
practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today — the
Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when
objects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick had given
each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory
being that these wouldn’t hurt anyone if they went off target. It was
a good theory, but it wasn’t working very well. Neville’s aim was so
poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying
across the room — Professor Flitwick, for instance.
“Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?” Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top

of a large cabinet. “I’m trying to tell you about Snape and
Moody. . . .”
This class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry
had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.
“Snape said Moody’s searched his office as well?” Ron whispered,
his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep
of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati’s hat off).
“What . . . d’you reckon Moody’s here to keep an eye on Snape as
well as Karkaroff?”
“Well, I dunno if that’s what Dumbledore asked him to do, but
he’s definitely doing it,” said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly
flop off the desk. “Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay
here because he’s giving him a second chance or something. . . .”
“What?” said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning
high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping
heavily onto Flitwick’s desk. “Harry . . . maybe Moody thinks
Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire!”
“Oh Ron,” said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, “we
thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he
was saving Harry’s life, remember?”
She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed
in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at
Hermione, thinking . . . it was true that Snape had saved his life
once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as
he’d loathed Harry’s father when they had been at school together.
Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never

  
missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest
that he should be suspended from the school.
“I don’t care what Moody says,” Hermione went on. “Dumbledore’s not stupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin,
even though loads of people wouldn’t have given them jobs, so why
shouldn’t he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit —”
“— evil,” said Ron promptly. “Come on, Hermione, why are all
these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then?”
“Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?” said Hermione, ignoring Ron. “It’s a bit funny, isn’t it, that he can’t manage to
come to the Yule Ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the
night when he wants to?”
“You just don’t like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,” said
Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window.
“You just want to think Snape’s up to something,” said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box.
“I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he’s
on his second one,” said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very
great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on
top of Hermione’s.
Obedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining
all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape’s office, and Moody and
Snape’s conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to
the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive underwater
for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.
Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm
again — Harry had explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn’t

  
see why Harry shouldn’t Summon one from the nearest Muggle
town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an AquaLung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified
for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was
too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung
zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure
yourself into a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only
we’d done human Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we
start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don’t
know what you’re doing. . . .”
“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking
out of my head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he might do it for me. . . .”
“I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned
into, though,” said Hermione seriously. “No, I think your best
chance is some sort of charm.”
So Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the
library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among
the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and
Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole
weekends — though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note
of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they
found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an
hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now,

  
and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The
lake, which Harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly water, whose dark
and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.
Just as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was slipping
away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extrafast. There was a week to go before February the twenty-fourth
(there was still time) . . . there were five days to go (he was bound
to find something soon) . . . three days to go (please let me find
something . . . please) . . .
With two days left, Harry started to go off food again. The only
good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the
brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He pulled off the parchment,
unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to
him.
Send date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl.
Harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see something else, but it was blank.
“Weekend after next,” whispered Hermione, who had read the
note over Harry’s shoulder. “Here — take my quill and send this
owl back straight away.”
Harry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius’s letter, tied
it onto the brown owl’s leg, and watched it take flight again. What
had he expected? Advice on how to survive underwater? He had
been so intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody he had
completely forgotten to mention the egg’s clue.

  
“What’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend
for?” said Ron.
“Dunno,” said Harry dully. The momentary happiness that had
flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died. “Come on . . .
Care of Magical Creatures.”
Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-Ended
Skrewts, or because there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that Professor
Grubbly-Plank could, Harry didn’t know, but Hagrid had been
continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d returned to
work. It turned out that Hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about monsters, though it was clear that he found
their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing.
Today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals. Unlike
full-grown unicorns, they were pure gold. Parvati and Lavender
went into transports of delight at the sight of them, and even Pansy
Parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them.
“Easier ter spot than the adults,” Hagrid told the class. “They
turn silver when they’re abou’ two years old, an’ they grow horns at
aroun’ four. Don’ go pure white till they’re full grown, ’round about
seven. They’re a bit more trustin’ when they’re babies . . . don’
mind boys so much. . . . C’mon, move in a bit, yeh can pat ’em if
yeh want . . . give ’em a few o’ these sugar lumps. . . .
“You okay, Harry?” Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly,
while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns.
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“Jus’ nervous, eh?” said Hagrid.
“Bit,” said Harry.
“Harry,” said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder,

  
so that Harry’s knees buckled under its weight, “I’d’ve bin worried
before I saw yeh take on tha’ Horntail, but I know now yeh can do
anythin’ yeh set yer mind ter. I’m not worried at all. Yeh’re goin’ ter
be fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven’ yeh?”
Harry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess
that he didn’t have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the
lake for an hour came over him. He looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it? He looked after everything else on the grounds, after
all —
“Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” Hagrid growled, patting Harry’s shoulder
again, so that Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches
into the soft ground. “I know it. I can feel it. Yeh’re goin’ ter win,
Harry.”
Harry just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy, confident
smile off Hagrid’s face. Pretending he was interested in the young
unicorns, he forced a smile in return, and moved forward to pat
them with the others.
By the evening before the second task, Harry felt as though he were
trapped in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some
miracle, he managed to find a suitable spell, he’d have a real job
mastering it overnight. How could he have let this happen? Why
hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner? Why had he ever let
his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once mentioned
how to breathe underwater?
He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden
from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front

  
of each of them. Harry’s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw
the word “water” on a page, but more often than not it was merely
“Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake
leaves, and a newt . . .”
“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the
other side of the table. “There’s nothing. Nothing. Closest was that
thing to dry up puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that
was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake.”
“There must be something,” Hermione muttered, moving a
candle closer to her. Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the
tiny print of Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with
her nose about an inch from the page. “They’d never have set a task
that was undoable.”
“They have,” said Ron. “Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back
whatever they’ve nicked, and see if they chuck it out. Best you can
do, mate.”
“There’s a way of doing it!” Hermione said crossly. “There just
has to be!”
She seemed to be taking the library’s lack of useful information
on the subject as a personal insult; it had never failed her before.
“I know what I should have done,” said Harry, resting, facedown, on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts. “I should’ve learned to be an
Animagus like Sirius.”
An Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal.
“Yeah, you could’ve turned into a goldfish any time you
wanted!” said Ron.
“Or a frog,” yawned Harry. He was exhausted.
“It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you have to

  
register yourself and everything,” said Hermione vaguely, now
squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their
Solutions. “Professor McGonagall told us, remember . . . you’ve
got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office . . .
what animal you become, and your markings, so you can’t abuse
it. . . .”
“Hermione, I was joking,” said Harry wearily. “I know I haven’t
got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning. . . .”
“Oh this is no use,” Hermione said, snapping shut Weird Wizarding Dilemmas. “Who on earth wants to make their nose hair
grow into ringlets?”
“I wouldn’t mind,” said Fred Weasley’s voice. “Be a talking
point, wouldn’t it?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and George had just
emerged from behind some bookshelves.
“What’re you two doing here?” Ron asked.
“Looking for you,” said George. “McGonagall wants you, Ron.
And you, Hermione.”
“Why?” said Hermione, looking surprised.
“Dunno . . . she was looking a bit grim, though,” said Fred.
“We’re supposed to take you down to her office,” said George.
Ron and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his stomach drop.
Was Professor McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off?
Perhaps she’d noticed how much they were helping him, when he
ought to be working out how to do the task alone?
“We’ll meet you back in the common room,” Hermione told
Harry as she got up to go with Ron — both of them looked very
anxious. “Bring as many of these books as you can, okay?”
“Right,” said Harry uneasily.

  
By eight o’clock, Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps
and came to chivvy Harry out of the library. Staggering under the
weight of as many books as he could carry, Harry returned to the
Gryffindor common room, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to search. There was nothing in Madcap Magic for Wacky
Warlocks . . . nothing in A Guide to Medieval Sorcery . . . not one
mention of underwater exploits in An Anthology of EighteenthCentury Charms, or in Dreadful Denizens of the Deep, or Powers
You Never Knew You Had and What to Do with Them Now You’ve
Wised Up.
Crookshanks crawled into Harry’s lap and curled up, purring
deeply. The common room emptied slowly around Harry. People
kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery, confident
voices like Hagrid’s, all of them apparently convinced that he was
about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had
managed in the first task. Harry couldn’t answer them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat. By
ten to midnight, he was alone in the room with Crookshanks. He
had searched all the remaining books, and Ron and Hermione had
not come back.
It’s over, he told himself. You can’t do it. You’ll just have to go
down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges. . . .
He imagined himself explaining that he couldn’t do the task. He
pictured Bagman’s look of round-eyed surprise, Karkaroff’s satisfied, yellow-toothed smile. He could almost hear Fleur Delacour
saying “I knew it . . . ’e is too young, ’e is only a little boy.” He saw
Malfoy flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the
crowd, saw Hagrid’s crestfallen, disbelieving face. . . .
Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap, Harry stood up

  
very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the
floor, gave Harry a disgusted look, and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air, but Harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory. . . . He would grab the Invisibility
Cloak and go back to the library, he’d stay there all night if he had
to. . . .
“Lumos,” Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the
library door.
Wand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves, pulling down
more books — books of hexes and charms, books on merpeople
and water monsters, books on famous witches and wizards, on
magical inventions, on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival. He carried them over to a
table, then set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of his
wand, occasionally checking his watch. . . .
One in the morning . . . two in the morning . . . the only way
he could keep going was to tell himself, over and over again, next
book . . . in the next one . . . the next one . . .
The mermaid in the painting in the prefects’ bathroom was laughing. Harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her
rock, while she held his Firebolt over his head.
“Come and get it!” she giggled maliciously. “Come on, jump!”
“I can’t,” Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and struggling
not to sink. “Give it to me!”
But she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the
broomstick, laughing at him.
“That hurts — get off — ouch —”
“Harry Potter must wake up, sir!”

  
“Stop poking me —”
“Dobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake up!”
Harry opened his eyes. He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he’d slept, and the side of his
face was stuck to the pages of Where There’s a Wand, There’s a Way.
He sat up, straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright daylight.
“Harry Potter needs to hurry!” squeaked Dobby. “The second
task starts in ten minutes, and Harry Potter —”
“Ten minutes?” Harry croaked. “Ten — ten minutes?”
He looked down at his watch. Dobby was right. It was twenty
past nine. A large, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry’s chest
into his stomach.
“Hurry, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry’s
sleeve. “You is supposed to be down by the lake with the other
champions, sir!”
“It’s too late, Dobby,” Harry said hopelessly. “I’m not doing the
task, I don’t know how —”
“Harry Potter will do the task!” squeaked the elf. “Dobby knew
Harry had not found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!”
“What?” said Harry. “But you don’t know what the second task
is —”
“Dobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find
his Wheezy —”
“Find my what?”
“— and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!”
“What’s a Wheezy?”
“Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy — Wheezy who is giving
Dobby his sweater!”

  
Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now
wearing over his shorts.
“What?” Harry gasped. “They’ve got . . . they’ve got Ron?”
“The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked Dobby.
“ ‘But past an hour —’ ”
“— ‘the prospect’s black,’ ” Harry recited, staring, horror-struck, at
the elf. “ ‘Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.’ Dobby — what’ve I
got to do?”
“You has to eat this, sir!” squeaked the elf, and he put his hand
in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like
slimy, grayish-green rat tails. “Right before you go into the lake,
sir — gillyweed!”
“What’s it do?” said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.
“It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!”
“Dobby,” said Harry frantically, “listen — are you sure about
this?”
He couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to
“help” him, he had ended up with no bones in his right arm.
“Dobby is quite sure, sir!” said the elf earnestly. “Dobby hears
things, sir, he is a house-elf, he goes all over the castle as he lights
the fires and mops the floors. Dobby heard Professor McGonagall
and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next
task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!”
Harry’s doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the
Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed,
and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby
at his heels.
“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed

  
as they burst into the corridor. “Dobby will be missed — good
luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!”
“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he sprinted along
the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.
The entrance hall contained a few last-minute stragglers, all
leaving the Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the
double oak doors to watch the second task. They stared as Harry
flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt
down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds.
As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons’ enclosure in November were now ranged along
the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to the bursting
point and reflected in the lake below. The excited babble of the
crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran flat-out
around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were sitting at another gold-draped table at the water’s edge. Cedric, Fleur,
and Krum were beside the judges’ table, watching Harry sprint toward them.
“I’m . . . here . . .” Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud
and accidentally splattering Fleur’s robes.
“Where have you been?” said a bossy, disapproving voice. “The
task’s about to start!”
Harry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges’
table — Mr. Crouch had failed to turn up again.
“Now, now, Percy!” said Ludo Bagman, who was looking intensely relieved to see Harry. “Let him catch his breath!”
Dumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and Madame
Maxime didn’t look at all pleased to see him. . . . It was obvious

  
from the looks on their faces that they had thought he wasn’t going
to turn up.
Harry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath; he had
a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his
ribs, but there was no time to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now
moving among the champions, spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of the line, next to
Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his
wand ready.
“All right, Harry?” Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few
feet farther away from Krum. “Know what you’re going to do?”
“Yeah,” Harry panted, massaging his ribs.
Bagman gave Harry’s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to
the judges’ table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done
at the World Cup, said, “Sonorus!” and his voice boomed out across
the dark water toward the stands.
“Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which
will start on my whistle. They have precisely an hour to recover
what has been taken from them. On the count of three, then.
One . . . two . . . three!”
The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands
erupted with cheers and applause; without looking to see what the
other champions were doing, Harry pulled off his shoes and socks,
pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into his
mouth, and waded out into the lake.
It was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this
were fire, not icy water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he
walked in deeper; now the water was over his knees, and his rapidly

  
numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones. He was
chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist-deep in the
freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to
happen.
He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical
power. The part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his hair,
Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided looking at the stands;
the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. . . .
Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow
had been pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw
breath, but it made his head spin; his lungs were empty, and he
suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck —
Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits
just below his ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . He had gills. Without pausing to think, he did the only thing that made sense — he
flung himself forward into the water.
The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His
head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water
and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to
his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at
them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they
had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare
feet — they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too:
It looked as though he had sprouted flippers.
The water didn’t feel icy anymore either . . . on the contrary, he

  
felt pleasantly cool and very light. . . . Harry struck out once more,
marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him
through the water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how
he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon swum so far
into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He flipped
over and dived into its depths.
Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark,
foggy landscape. He could only see ten feet around him, so that as
he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly
out of the oncoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black
weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He
swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his
eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to
the shadows beyond, where the water became opaque.
Small fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he
thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when
he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened
log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the
other champions, merpeople, Ron — nor, thankfully, the giant
squid.
Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see,
two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was
staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes
through the gloom . . . and then, without warning, something
grabbed hold of his ankle.
Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small,
horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers
clutched tightly around Harry’s leg, its pointed fangs bared —
Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled

  
for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows
had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry’s robes,
and were attempting to drag him down.
“Relashio!” Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. . . . A
large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be
a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches
appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of the
grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending
more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and
then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he
kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned
skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away,
cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank
back into the weed.
Harry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back inside his
robes, and looked around, listening again. He turned full circle in
the water, the silence pressing harder than ever against his
eardrums. He knew he must be even deeper in the lake now, but
nothing was moving but the rippling weed.
“How are you getting on?”
Harry thought he was having a heart attack. He whipped around
and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at
him through her thick, pearly glasses.
“Myrtle!” Harry tried to shout — but once again, nothing came
out of his mouth but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually
giggled.
“You want to try over there!” she said, pointing. “I won’t come

  
with you. . . . I don’t like them much, they always chase me when I
get too close. . . .”
Harry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks and set off
once more, careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any
more grindylows that might be lurking there.
He swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. He was
passing over vast expanses of black mud now, which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water. Then, at long last, he heard a snatch
of haunting mersong.
“An hour long you’ll have to look,
And to recover what we took . . .”
Harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the
muddy water ahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were
carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry
swam on past the rock, following the mersong.
“. . . your time’s half gone, so tarry not
Lest what you seek stays here to rot. . . .”
A cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed
suddenly out of the gloom on all sides. Here and there at the dark
windows, Harry saw faces . . . faces that bore no resemblance at all
to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects’ bathroom. . . .
The merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark green hair.
Their eyes were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore
thick ropes of pebbles around their necks. They leered at Harry as

  
he swam past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to
watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the water,
spears clutched in their hands.
Harry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became
more numerous; there were gardens of weed around some of them,
and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door.
Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching him eagerly,
pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind their hands
to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight
met his eyes.
A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses
that lined what looked like a mer-version of a village square. A
choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a
gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were bound
tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.
Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was
also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery
hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour’s sister. All
four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep. Their heads were
lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths.
Harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to
lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The
ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and
very strong. For a fleeting second he thought of the knife Sirius had
bought him for Christmas — locked in his trunk in the castle a
quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.
He looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them

  
were carrying spears. He swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall
merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and
tried to mime a request to borrow the spear. The merman laughed
and shook his head.
“We do not help,” he said in a harsh, croaky voice.
“Come ON !” Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from
his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman,
but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing.
Harry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp . . . anything . . .
There were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and
snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue.
He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron, and after several minutes’ hard work, they broke apart. Ron floated, unconscious, a few
inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the
water.
Harry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other
champions. What were they playing at? Why didn’t they hurry up?
He turned back to Hermione, raised the jagged rock, and began to
hack at her bindings too —
At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him. Half a
dozen mermen were pulling him away from Hermione, shaking
their green-haired heads, and laughing.
“You take your own hostage,” one of them said to him. “Leave
the others . . .”
“No way!” said Harry furiously — but only two large bubbles
came out.
“Your task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the others . . .”
“She’s my friend too!” Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione,

  
an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips. “And
I don’t want them to die either!”
Cho’s head was on Hermione’s shoulder; the small silver-haired
girl was ghostly green and pale. Harry struggled to fight off the
mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding him back.
Harry looked wildly around. Where were the other champions?
Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come back
down for Hermione and the others? Would he be able to find them
again? He looked down at his watch to see how much time was
left — it had stopped working.
But then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his
head. Harry looked up and saw Cedric swimming toward them.
There was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his
features look oddly wide and stretched.
“Got lost!” he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. “Fleur and
Krum’re coming now!”
Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife
out of his pocket and cut Cho free. He pulled her upward and out
of sight.
Harry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and Krum?
Time was getting short, and according to the song, the hostages
would be lost after an hour. . . .
The merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those holding
Harry loosened their grip, staring behind them. Harry turned and
saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them:
a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. . . . It
was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured himself — but badly.
The shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began snapping
and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that Krum’s new teeth were

  
positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry was quite sure that if Krum wasn’t careful, he was
going to rip Hermione in half. Darting forward, Harry hit Krum
hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone. Krum seized it
and began to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it;
he grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a backward
glance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface.
Now what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be sure that
Fleur was coming. . . . But still no sign. There was nothing to be
done except . . .
He snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the
mermen now closed in around Ron and the little girl, shaking their
heads at him. Harry pulled out his wand.
“Get out of the way!”
Only bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct
impression that the mermen had understood him, because they
suddenly stopped laughing. Their yellowish eyes were fixed upon
Harry’s wand, and they looked scared. There might be a lot more
of them than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the looks
on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid
did.
“You’ve got until three!” Harry shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from him, but he held up three fingers to make sure they
got the message. “One . . .” (he put down a finger) “two . . .” (he
put down a second one) —
They scattered. Harry darted forward and began to hack at the
ropes binding the small girl to the statue, and at last she was free.
He seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron’s
robes, and kicked off from the bottom.

  
It was very slow work. He could no longer use his webbed hands
to propel himself forward; he worked his flippers furiously, but
Ron and Fleur’s sister were like potato-filled sacks dragging him
back down. . . . He fixed his eyes skyward, though he knew he
must still be very deep, the water above him was so dark. . . .
Merpeople were rising with him. He could see them swirling
around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water. . . . Would they pull him back down to the depths when the
time was up? Did they perhaps eat humans? Harry’s legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were aching
horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and the girl. . . .
He was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He could feel
pain on the sides of his neck again . . . he was becoming very aware
of how wet the water was in his mouth . . . yet the darkness was
definitely thinning now . . . he could see daylight above him. . . .
He kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were
nothing more than feet . . . water was flooding through his mouth
into his lungs . . . he was starting to feel dizzy, but he knew light
and air were only ten feet above him . . . he had to get there . . . he
had to . . .
Harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest; his very brain felt waterlogged, he
couldn’t breathe, he needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could
not stop —
And then he felt his head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet face sting; he gulped it down,
feeling as though he had never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled Ron and the little girl up with him. All around him,

  
wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of the water with him,
but they were smiling at him.
The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; Harry had
the impression they thought that Ron and the little girl might be
dead, but they were wrong . . . both of them had opened their eyes;
the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely expelled a
great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to Harry,
and said, “Wet, this, isn’t it?” Then he spotted Fleur’s sister. “What
did you bring her for?”
“Fleur didn’t turn up, I couldn’t leave her,” Harry panted.
“Harry, you prat,” said Ron, “you didn’t take that song thing seriously, did you? Dumbledore wouldn’t have let any of us drown!”
“The song said —”
“It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!”
said Ron. “I hope you didn’t waste time down there acting the
hero!”
Harry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very well for Ron;
he’d been asleep, he hadn’t felt how eerie it was down in the lake,
surrounded by spear-carrying merpeople who’d looked more than
capable of murder.
“C’mon,” Harry said shortly, “help me with her, I don’t think
she can swim very well.”
They pulled Fleur’s sister through the water, back toward the bank
where the judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying
them like a guard of honor, singing their horrible screechy songs.
Harry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum,
Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.

  
Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron
from the bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very
white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out
to meet them. Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to restrain
Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail to
return to the water.
“Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is she ’urt?”
“She’s fine!” Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he
could hardly talk, let alone shout.
Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling
Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was
hugging her sister.
“It was ze grindylows . . . zey attacked me . . . oh Gabrielle, I
thought . . . I thought . . .”
“Come here, you,” said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and
pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so
tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket,
and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam
gushed out of his ears.
“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried. “You did it, you found out
how all by yourself!”
“Well —” said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but
he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge
who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of
pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back
safely. “Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, raising his voice slightly so
that Karkaroff could hear him.
“You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny,” said

  
Krum. Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just
rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle
impatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time limit, though,
Harry. . . . Did it take you ages to find us?”
“No . . . I found you okay. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was out of the
water, it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledore’s safety precautions wouldn’t have permitted the death of a hostage just because
their champion hadn’t turned up. Why hadn’t he just grabbed Ron
and gone? He would have been first back. . . . Cedric and Krum
hadn’t wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn’t taken
the mersong seriously. . . .
Dumbledore was crouching at the water’s edge, deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly
wild and ferocious-looking female. He was making the same sort of
screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish. Finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said, “A conference before
we give the marks, I think.”
The judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to
rescue Ron from Percy’s clutches; she led him over to Harry and the
others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went
to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fleur had many cuts on her face and
arms and her robes were torn, but she didn’t seem to care, nor
would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.
“Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she turned to
Harry. “You saved ’er,” she said breathlessly. “Even though she was
not your ’ostage.”

  
“Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he’d left all
three girls tied to the statue.
Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his
face burn and wouldn’t have been surprised if steam was coming
out of his ears again), then said to Ron, “And you too — you
’elped —”
“Yeah,” said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a bit —”
Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. Hermione
looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo Bagman’s magically
magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump,
and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision. Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of
the lake, and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty
for each of the champions, as follows. . . .
“Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the
Bubble-Head Charm, was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to retrieve her hostage. We award her
twenty-five points.”
Applause from the stands.
“I deserved zero,” said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent
head.
“Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was
first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute
outside the time limit of an hour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look.
“We therefore award him forty-seven points.”
Harry’s heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he
most certainly had been.

  
“Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration,
which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his
hostage. We award him forty points.”
Karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior.
“Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect,” Bagman continued. “He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour.
However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first
to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to
his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his
own.”
Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated, halfcommiserating looks.
“Most of the judges,” and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very
nasty look, “feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks.
However . . . Mr. Potter’s score is forty-five points.”
Harry’s stomach leapt — he was now tying for first place with
Cedric. Ron and Hermione, caught by surprise, stared at Harry, then
laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.
“There you go, Harry!” Ron shouted over the noise. “You
weren’t being thick after all — you were showing moral fiber!”
Fleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn’t look happy at
all. He attempted to engage Hermione in conversation again, but
she was too busy cheering Harry to listen.
“The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twentyfourth of June,” continued Bagman. “The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand. Thank you
all for your support of the champions.”
It was over, Harry thought dazedly, as Madam Pomfrey began
herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into

  
dry clothes . . . it was over, he had got through . . . he didn’t have
to worry about anything now until June the twenty-fourth. . . .
Next time he was in Hogsmeade, Harry decided as he walked
back up the stone steps into the castle, he was going to buy Dobby
a pair of socks for every day of the year.

C H A P T E R T W E N T Y - S E V E N
PADFOOT RETURN S

One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task
was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what
had happened down in the lake, which meant that Ron was getting
to share Harry’s limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron’s version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave
what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione’s story, anyway — Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched
sleep in Professor McGonagall’s office, first assuring them that they
would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above
the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale
of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before
tying him up.
“But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,” he assured Padma
Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him
O

  
every time they passed in the corridors. “I could’ve taken those
mer-idiots any time I wanted.”
“What were you going to do, snore at them?” said Hermione
waspishly. People had been teasing her so much about being the
thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that she was in a rather
tetchy mood.
Ron’s ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched
sleep version of events.
As they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel
winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto
the grounds. There were delays in the post because the owls kept
being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong
way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius’s reply than it took flight,
clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again.
Sirius’s letter was almost as short as the previous one.
Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and
Banges) at two o’clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much
food as you can.
“He hasn’t come back to Hogsmeade?” said Ron incredulously.
“It looks like it, doesn’t it?” said Hermione.
“I can’t believe him,” said Harry tensely, “if he’s caught . . .”
“Made it so far, though, hasn’t he?” said Ron. “And it’s not like
the place is swarming with dementors anymore.”
Harry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached

  
the final lesson of the afternoon — double Potions — feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the
steps to the dungeons.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside
the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s gang of Slytherin girls.
All of them were looking at something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily. Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around
Goyle’s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.
“There they are, there they are!” she giggled, and the knot of
Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her
hands — Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a
curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large
sponge cake with her wand.
“You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!”
Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who
caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door
opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside.
Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the
dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to
write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard,
Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. At
last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking
for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry
headed a short piece entitled:
Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache
A boy like no other, perhaps — yet a boy suffering
all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita
Skeeter. Deprived of love since the tragic demise

  
of his parents, fourteen-year-old Harry Potter
thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend
at Hogwarts, Muggle-born Hermione Granger.
Little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss.
Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems
to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone
cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last
World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys’ affections. Krum, who is
openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has
already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the
summer holidays, and insists that he has “never felt
this way about any other girl.”
However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys’ interest.
“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty
and vivacious fourth-year student, “but she’d be
well up to making a Love Potion, she’s quite brainy.
I think that’s how she’s doing it.”
Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want
to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry
Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he
bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.

  
“I told you!” Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the
article. “I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She’s made you out to
be some sort of — of scarlet woman!”
Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter.
“Scarlet woman?” she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as
she looked around at Ron.
“It’s what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his ears going
red.
“If that’s the best Rita can do, she’s losing her touch,” said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty
chair beside her. “What a pile of old rubbish.”
She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and
Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the
article. Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she,
Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need
for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.
“There’s something funny, though,” said Hermione ten minutes
later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles.
“How could Rita Skeeter have known . . . ?”
“Known what?” said Ron quickly. “You haven’t been mixing up
Love Potions, have you?”
“Don’t be stupid,” Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her
beetles again. “No, it’s just . . . how did she know Viktor asked me
to visit him over the summer?”
Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly
avoided Ron’s eyes.
“What?” said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.
“He asked me right after he’d pulled me out of the lake,”

  
Hermione muttered. “After he’d got rid of his shark’s head. Madam
Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away
from the judges so they wouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing
anything over the summer, would I like to —”
“And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up his pestle
and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl,
because he was looking at Hermione.
“And he did say he’d never felt the same way about anyone else,”
Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel
the heat coming from her, “but how could Rita Skeeter have heard
him? She wasn’t there . . . or was she? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task. . . .”
“And what did you say?” Ron repeated, pounding his pestle
down so hard that it dented the desk.
“Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay
to —”
“Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is, Miss
Granger,” said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them
jumped, “I must ask you not to discuss it in my class. Ten points
from Gryffindor.”
Snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The
whole class was now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.
“Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?” Snape
added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly. “A further ten points
from Gryffindor . . . oh but of course . . .” Snape’s black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter’s article. “Potter has to keep up
with his press cuttings. . . .”

  
The dungeon rang with the Slytherins’ laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape’s thin mouth. To Harry’s fury, he began
to read the article aloud.
“ ‘Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache . . . dear, dear, Potter, what’s ailing you now? ‘A boy like no other, perhaps . . .’ ”
Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end
of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article
sounded ten times worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was
blushing scarlet now.
“ ‘. . . Harry Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.’ How very touching,”
sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of
laughter from the Slytherins. “Well, I think I had better separate
the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather
than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss
Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter — that table in
front of my desk. Move. Now.”
Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty
table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to
have Snape’s face.
“All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head, Potter,” said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had
settled down again.
Harry didn’t answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him;
he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to
take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class.

  
“You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” Snape went on, so quietly
that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his
scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very
fine powder), “but I don’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me, Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him.”
Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started
cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of
anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn’t hear what
Snape was saying to him.
“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” Snape continued in a softer
and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized celebrity or not — if I catch
you breaking into my office one more time —”
“I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said Harry angrily,
forgetting his feigned deafness.
“Don’t lie to me,” Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring
into Harry’s. “Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my
private stores, and I know who stole them.”
Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look
guilty. In truth, he hadn’t stolen either of these things from Snape.
Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second
year — they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while
Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to
prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry lied coldly.
“You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!”
Snape hissed. “I know it, Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might
have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior!

  
One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will
pay!
“Right,” said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. “I’ll
bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.”
Snape’s eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his
black robes. For one wild moment, Harry thought Snape was
about to pull out his wand and curse him — then he saw that
Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it.
“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again.
“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time.
“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops
would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class
to hear,” said Snape viciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch
your step, you might just find that my hand slips” — he shook the
crystal bottle slightly — “right over your evening pumpkin juice.
And then, Potter . . . then we’ll find out whether you’ve been in my
office or not.”
Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once
more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn’t
like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past
Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of
what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it . . . quite
apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble — Hermione
and Dobby for a start — there were all the other things he was
concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . .
and — his insides squirmed at the thought — how he felt about

  
Cho. . . . He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and
wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody’s book and
start drinking only from a private hip flask.
There was a knock on the dungeon door.
“Enter,” said Snape in his usual voice.
The class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff
came in. Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape’s
desk. He was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking
agitated.
“We need to talk,” said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached
Snape. He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he
was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he
were a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his ginger
roots, listening hard.
“I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” Snape muttered, but
Karkaroff interrupted him.
“I want to talk now, while you can’t slip off, Severus. You’ve been
avoiding me.”
“After the lesson,” Snape snapped.
Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he’d
poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance
at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape
looked angry.
Karkaroff hovered behind Snape’s desk for the rest of the double
period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away
at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say,
Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with
two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck

  
down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class
moved noisily toward the door.
“What’s so urgent?” he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.
“This,” said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his
cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left-hand sleeve of his robe and
show Snape something on his inner forearm.
“Well?” said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his
lips. “Do you see? It’s never been this clear, never since —”
“Put it away!” snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.
“But you must have noticed —” Karkaroff began in an agitated
voice.
“We can talk later, Karkaroff!” spat Snape. “Potter! What are you
doing?”
“Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,” said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was
holding.
Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He
looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with
an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and
Hermione what he had just witnessed.
They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun
shining down upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it
had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all
three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over
their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in

  
Harry’s bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread,
and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table.
They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for
Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they
could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver
stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too
smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High
Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the
village.
Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding
lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around
Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens
larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in
whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and
saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws
on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which
was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very
familiar. . . .
“Hello, Sirius,” said Harry when they had reached him.
The black dog sniffed Harry’s bag eagerly, wagged its tail once,
then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby
patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed.
Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the
ground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him,
with his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out
of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself.
For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony

  
path, following Sirius’s wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry’s bag cutting into his shoulders.
Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached
the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the
rock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly
lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large
rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak’s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All
three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck.
Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just
turned into his godfather.
Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been
wearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than
it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and
matted once more. He looked very thin.
“Chicken!” he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets
from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor.
Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of
chicken legs and bread.
“Thanks,” said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting
down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth.
“I’ve been living off rats mostly. Can’t steal too much food from
Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself.”
He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only
reluctantly.
“What’re you doing here, Sirius?” he said.

  
“Fulfilling my duty as godfather,” said Sirius, gnawing on the
chicken bone in a very doglike way. “Don’t worry about it, I’m pretending to be a lovable stray.”
He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harry’s face, said
more seriously, “I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well,
let’s just say things are getting fishier. I’ve been stealing the paper
every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I’m
not the only one who’s getting worried.”
He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and
Ron picked them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius.
“What if they catch you? What if you’re seen?”
“You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who
know I’m an Animagus,” said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to
devour the chicken leg.
Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There
were two: The first bore the headline Mystery Illness of Bartemius
Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch Still Missing — Minister of
Magic Now Personally Involved.
Harry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at
him: hasn’t been seen in public since November . . . house appears
deserted . . . St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries
decline comment . . . Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical
illness. . . .
“They’re making it sound like he’s dying,” said Harry slowly.
“But he can’t be that ill if he managed to get up here. . . .”
“My brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant,” Ron informed Sirius.
“He says Crouch is suffering from overwork.”

  
“Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,” said
Harry slowly, still reading the story. “The night my name came out
of the goblet. . . .”
“Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn’t he?” said
Hermione, an edge to her voice. She was stroking Buckbeak, who
was crunching up Sirius’s chicken bones. “I bet he wishes he hadn’t
done it now — bet he feels the difference now she’s not there to
look after him.”
“Hermione’s obsessed with house-elfs,” Ron muttered to Sirius,
casting Hermione a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested.
“Crouch sacked his house-elf?”
“Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,” said Harry, and he
launched into the story of the Dark Mark’s appearance, and Winky
being found with Harry’s wand clutched in her hand, and Mr.
Crouch’s fury. When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet
again and had started pacing up and down the cave.
“Let me get this straight,” he said after a while, brandishing a
fresh chicken leg. “You first saw the elf in the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?”
“Right,” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.
“But Crouch didn’t turn up for the match?”
“No,” said Harry. “I think he said he’d been too busy.”
Sirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, “Harry,
did you check your pockets for your wand after you’d left the Top
Box?”
“Erm . . .” Harry thought hard. “No,” he said finally. “I didn’t
need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand
in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.” He

  
stared at Sirius. “Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole
my wand in the Top Box?”
“It’s possible,” said Sirius.
“Winky didn’t steal that wand!” Hermione insisted.
“The elf wasn’t the only one in that box,” said Sirius, his brow
furrowed as he continued to pace. “Who else was sitting behind
you?”
“Loads of people,” said Harry. “Some Bulgarian ministers . . .
Cornelius Fudge . . . the Malfoys . . .”
“The Malfoys!” said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice
echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. “I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!”
“Anyone else?” said Sirius.
“No one,” said Harry.
“Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,” Hermione reminded
him.
“Oh yeah . . .”
“I don’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be
Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,” said Sirius, still pacing. “What’s
he like?”
“He’s okay,” said Harry. “He keeps offering to help me with the
Triwizard Tournament.”
“Does he, now?” said Sirius, frowning more deeply. “I wonder
why he’d do that?”
“Says he’s taken a liking to me,” said Harry.
“Hmm,” said Sirius, looking thoughtful.
“We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,”
Hermione told Sirius. “Remember?” she said to Harry and Ron.

  
“Yeah, but he didn’t stay in the forest, did he?” said Ron. “The
moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.”
“How d’you know?” Hermione shot back. “How d’you know
where he Disapparated to?”
“Come off it,” said Ron incredulously. “Are you saying you
reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?”
“It’s more likely he did it than Winky,” said Hermione
stubbornly.
“Told you,” said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, “told you
she’s obsessed with house —”
But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron.
“When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been
discovered holding Harry’s wand, what did Crouch do?”
“Went to look in the bushes,” said Harry, “but there wasn’t anyone else there.”
“Of course,” Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, “of course,
he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf . . . and then he
sacked her?”
“Yes,” said Hermione in a heated voice, “he sacked her, just because she hadn’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled —”
“Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!” said Ron.
Sirius shook his head and said, “She’s got the measure of Crouch
better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man’s like,
take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”
He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard.
“All these absences of Barty Crouch’s . . . he goes to the trouble
of making sure his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch
World Cup, but doesn’t bother to turn up and watch. He works

  
very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops
coming to that too. . . . It’s not like Crouch. If he’s ever taken a day
off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat Buckbeak.”
“D’you know Crouch, then?” said Harry.
Sirius’s face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he
had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still
believed Sirius to be a murderer.
“Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one
who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a
trial.”
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“You’re kidding!” said Harry.
“No, I’m not,” said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken.
“Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.
“He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said Sirius.
“He’s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical — and
power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,” he said, reading
the look on Harry’s face. “No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were
against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn’t understand . . . you’re
too young. . . .”
“That’s what my dad said at the World Cup,” said Ron, with a
trace of irritation in his voice. “Try us, why don’t you?”
A grin flashed across Sirius’s thin face.
“All right, I’ll try you. . . .” He walked once up the cave, back
again, and then said, “Imagine that Voldemort’s powerful now. You
don’t know who his supporters are, you don’t know who’s working

  
for him and who isn’t; you know he can control people so that they
do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You’re
scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week,
news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic’s in disarray, they don’t know what
to do, they’re trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles,
but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . .
panic . . . confusion . . . that’s how it used to be.
“Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the
worst in others. Crouch’s principles might’ve been good in the beginning — I wouldn’t know. He rose quickly through the Ministry,
and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort’s
supporters. The Aurors were given new powers — powers to kill
rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn’t the only one who
was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought
violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable
Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel
as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you —
plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way,
and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to
take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it
looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But
then something rather unfortunate happened. . . .” Sirius smiled
grimly. “Crouch’s own son was caught with a group of Death
Eaters who’d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.”
“Crouch’s son was caught?” gasped Hermione.
“Yep,” said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak,
flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread,

  
and tearing it in half. “Nasty little shock for old Barty, I’d imagine.
Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family,
shouldn’t he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . .
gotten to know his own son.”
He began to wolf down large pieces of bread.
“Was his son a Death Eater?” said Harry.
“No idea,” said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. “I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I’ve found
out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company
of people I’d bet my life were Death Eaters — but he might have
been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf.”
“Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione whispered.
Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.
“Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him,
Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had
to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of
Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again — doesn’t that tell you what
he’s like? Crouch’s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to
give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn’t much more than
an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then
he sent him straight to Azkaban.”
“He gave his own son to the dementors?” asked Harry quietly.
“That’s right,” said Sirius, and he didn’t look remotely amused
now. “I saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through
the bars in my cell door. He can’t have been more than nineteen.
They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his
mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . . .

  
they all went quiet in the end . . . except when they shrieked in
their sleep. . . .”
For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius’s eyes became more
pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.
“So he’s still in Azkaban?” Harry said.
“No,” said Sirius dully. “No, he’s not in there anymore. He died
about a year after they brought him in.”
“He died?”
“He wasn’t the only one,” said Sirius bitterly. “Most go mad in
there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live.
You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty
sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last
time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She
died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just
like the boy. Crouch never came for his son’s body. The dementors
buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it.”
Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and
instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.
“So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,”
he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “One
moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic . . . next, his
son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I’ve
heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had
died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son
and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had
gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared

  
much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch
was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.”
There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way
Crouch’s eyes had bulged as he’d looked down at his disobedient
house-elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup. This,
then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being
found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of
his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry.
“Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,”
Harry told Sirius.
“Yeah, I’ve heard it’s become a bit of a mania with him,” said Sirius, nodding. “If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the
old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.”
“And he sneaked up here to search Snape’s office!” said Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione.
“Yes, and that doesn’t make sense at all,” said Sirius.
“Yeah, it does!” said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head.
“Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn’t he
been coming to judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse
to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.”
“So you think Snape could be up to something, then?” asked
Harry, but Hermione broke in.
“Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape —”
“Oh give it a rest, Hermione,” said Ron impatiently. “I know
Dumbledore’s brilliant and everything, but that doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool him —”
“Why did Snape save Harry’s life in the first year, then? Why
didn’t he just let him die?”

  
“I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him
out —”
“What d’you think, Sirius?” Harry said loudly, and Ron and
Hermione stopped bickering to listen.
“I think they’ve both got a point,” said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. “Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I’ve wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape’s always
been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school.
Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,” Sirius added, and Harry and
Ron grinned at each other. “Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of
a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.”
Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names.
“Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year
before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges — they’re a married couple —
they’re in Azkaban. Avery — from what I’ve heard he wormed his
way out of trouble by saying he’d been acting under the Imperius
Curse — he’s still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even
accused of being a Death Eater — not that that means much. Plenty
of them were never caught. And Snape’s certainly clever and cunning
enough to keep himself out of trouble.”
“Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that
quiet,” said Ron.
“Yeah, you should’ve seen Snape’s face when Karkaroff turned
up in Potions yesterday!” said Harry quickly. “Karkaroff wanted to
talk to Snape, he says Snape’s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked
really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I
couldn’t see what it was.”
“He showed Snape something on his arm?” said Sirius, looking

  
frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his
filthy hair, then shrugged again. “Well, I’ve no idea what that’s
about . . . but if Karkaroff’s genuinely worried, and he’s going to
Snape for answers . . .”
Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration.
“There’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know
Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn’t, but I just
can’t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he’d ever worked
for Voldemort.”
“Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape’s office
then?” said Ron stubbornly.
“Well,” said Sirius slowly, “I wouldn’t put it past Mad-Eye to
have searched every single teacher’s office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously,
Moody. I’m not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he’s
seen, it’s not surprising. I’ll say this for Moody, though, he never
killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the
Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he’s a different matter . . . is he
really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to
Snape’s office? And if he’s not . . . what’s he up to? What was he
doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn’t turn up in
the Top Box? What’s he been doing while he should have been
judging the tournament?”
Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak
was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might
have overlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron.
“You say your brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant? Any chance
you could ask him if he’s seen Crouch lately?”

  
“I can try,” said Ron doubtfully. “Better not make it sound like
I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves
Crouch.”
“And you might try and find out whether they’ve got any leads
on Bertha Jorkins while you’re at it,” said Sirius, gesturing to the
second copy of the Daily Prophet.
“Bagman told me they hadn’t,” said Harry.
“Yes, he’s quoted in the article in there,” said Sirius, nodding at
the paper. “Blustering on about how bad Bertha’s memory is. Well,
maybe she’s changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn’t
forgetful at all — quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had
an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her
being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that’s
why Bagman didn’t bother to look for her for so long. . . .”
Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes.
“What’s the time?”
Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn’t been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake.
“It’s half past three,” said Hermione.
“You’d better get back to school,” Sirius said, getting to his feet.
“Now listen . . .” He looked particularly hard at Harry. “I don’t
want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send
notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But
you’re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be
an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.”
“No one’s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple
of grindylows,” Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him.
“I don’t care . . . I’ll breathe freely again when this tournament’s

  
over, and that’s not until June. And don’t forget, if you’re talking
about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?”
He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat
Buckbeak good-bye. “I’ll walk to the edge of the village with you,”
said Sirius, “see if I can scrounge another paper.”
He transformed into the great black dog before they left the
cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him,
across the boulder-strewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he
allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and
setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron,
and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.
“Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?” Ron said
as they walked up the drive to the castle. “But maybe he doesn’t
care . . . it’d probably just make him admire Crouch even more.
Yeah, Percy loves rules. He’d just say Crouch was refusing to break
them for his own son.”
“Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,”
said Hermione severely.
“I don’t know,” said Ron. “If he thought we were standing in the
way of his career . . . Percy’s really ambitious, you know. . . .”
They walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the
delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall.
“Poor old Snuffles,” said Ron, breathing deeply. “He must really
like you, Harry. . . . Imagine having to live off rats.”

C H A P T E R T W E N T Y - E I G H T
THE MADNESS OF
MR. CROUCH

Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after
breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy, asking, as
Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen Mr. Crouch lately. They
used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she’d had a job.
When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery
window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his
new socks.
The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and
curtsying and bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.
“Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!” he squeaked, wiping large
tears out of his enormous eyes.
“You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,”
said Harry.
“No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?” said Ron, who
was looking around at the beaming and bowing house-elves.
“You’ve just had breakfast!” said Hermione irritably, but a great
silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves.
“We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,” Harry
muttered.
“Good idea,” said Ron. “Give Pig something to do. You couldn’t
give us a bit of extra food, could you?” he said to the surrounding
elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more.
“Dobby, where’s Winky?” said Hermione, who was looking
around.
“Winky is over there by the fire, miss,” said Dobby quietly, his
ears drooping slightly.
“Oh dear,” said Hermione as she spotted Winky.
Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on
the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become
so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the
smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged and
unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying
slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her, she
gave an enormous hiccup.
“Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,” Dobby whispered to Harry.
“Well, it’s not strong, that stuff,” Harry said.
But Dobby shook his head. “ ’Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,” he
said.
Winky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs
gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work.
“Winky is pining, Harry Potter,” Dobby whispered sadly.
“Winky wants to go home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her
master, sir, and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now.”
“Hey, Winky,” said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, “you don’t know what Mr.
Crouch might be up to, do you? Because he’s stopped turning up
to judge the Triwizard Tournament.”
Winky’s eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry.
She swayed slightly again and then said, “M — Master is
stopped — hic — coming?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “we haven’t seen him since the first task. The
Daily Prophet’s saying he’s ill.”
Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.
“Master — hic — ill?”
Her bottom lip began to tremble.
“But we’re not sure if that’s true,” said Hermione quickly.
“Master is needing his — hic — Winky!” whimpered the elf.
“Master cannot — hic — manage — hic — all by himself. . . .”
“Other people manage to do their own housework, you know,
Winky,” Hermione said severely.
“Winky — hic — is not only — hic — doing housework for
Mr. Crouch!” Winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than
ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained
blouse. “Master is — hic — trusting Winky with — hic — the
most important — hic — the most secret —”
“What?” said Harry.
But Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer
down herself.
“Winky keeps — hic — her master’s secrets,” she said mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her
eyes crossed. “You is — hic — nosing, you is.”
“Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!” said Dobby angrily. “Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not
nosy!
“He is nosing — hic — into my master’s — hic — private and
secret — hic — Winky is a good house-elf — hic — Winky keeps
her silence — hic — people trying to — hic — pry and poke —
hic —”
Winky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she
slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle
of butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor. Half a
dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One
of them picked up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a
large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her
from view.
“We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!” squeaked a
nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. “We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!”
“She’s unhappy!” said Hermione, exasperated. “Why don’t you
try and cheer her up instead of covering her up?”
“Begging your pardon, miss,” said the house-elf, bowing deeply
again, “but house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is
work to be done and masters to be served.”
“Oh for heaven’s sake!” Hermione cried. “Listen to me, all of
you! You’ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You’ve
got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don’t
have to do everything you’re told — look at Dobby!”
“Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,” Dobby mumbled,
looking scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of
the house-elves around the kitchen. They were suddenly looking at
Hermione as though she were mad and dangerous.
“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s elbow, and
he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry’s
arms. “Good-bye!”
The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione
and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands
pushing in the smalls of their backs.
“Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!” Dobby called miserably from the hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy
tablecloth that was Winky.
“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?”
said Ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them.
“They won’t want us visiting them now! We could’ve tried to get
more stuff out of Winky about Crouch!”
“Oh as if you care about that!” scoffed Hermione. “You only like
coming down here for the food!”
It was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron
and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the
common room that he took Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that
evening on his own.
Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the
mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school
screech owls as well. When they had set off into the dusk, looking
extremely odd carrying the large package between them, Harry
leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the dark,
rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of
the Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke
rising from Hagrid’s chimney; it soared toward the castle, around
the Owlery, and out of sight. Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid
digging energetically in front of his cabin. Harry wondered what he
was doing; it looked as though he were making a new vegetable
patch. As he watched, Madame Maxime emerged from the Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid. She appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation. Hagrid leaned upon his spade,
but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because Madame
Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward.
Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and
Hermione snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging
until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past him into the night.
By breakfast the next day Ron’s and Hermione’s bad moods had
burnt out, and to Harry’s relief, Ron’s dark predictions that the
house-elves would send substandard food up to the Gryffindor
table because Hermione had insulted them proved false; the bacon,
eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.
When the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up eagerly; she
seemed to be expecting something.
“Percy won’t’ve had time to answer yet,” said Ron. “We only sent
Hedwig yesterday.”
“No, it’s not that,” said Hermione. “I’ve taken out a subscription
to the Daily Prophet. I’m getting sick of finding everything out from
the Slytherins.”
“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the owls. “Hey,
Hermione, I think you’re in luck —”
A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.
“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed. “It’s —”
But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her
plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.
“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said Harry, seizing
Hermione’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of
owls, all of whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their
own letter first.
“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter from the
gray owl, opening it, and starting to read. “Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.
“What’s up?” said Ron.
“It’s — oh how ridiculous —”
She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut
out of the Daily Prophet.
You are a WickEd giRL. HarRy PotTER desErves
BeTteR. GO back wherE you cAMe from mUGgle.
“They’re all like it!” said Hermione desperately, opening one letter after another. “ ‘Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of
you. . . .’ ‘You deserve to be boiled in frog spawn. . . .’ Ouch!”
She had opened the last envelope, and yellowish-green liquid
smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands, which began to
erupt in large yellow boils.
“Undiluted bubotuber pus!” said Ron, picking up the envelope
gingerly and sniffing it.
“Ow!” said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to
rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now
so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were
wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.
“You’d better get up to the hospital wing,” said Harry as the owls
around Hermione took flight. “We’ll tell Professor Sprout where
you’ve gone. . . .”
“I warned her!” said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great
Hall, cradling her hands. “I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter!
Look at this one . . .” He read out one of the letters Hermione had
left behind: “ ‘I read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing
Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be
sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.’ Blimey, she’d better watch out for herself.”
Hermione didn’t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left
the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle.
Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with
her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called,
“Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?”
Harry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of
knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused.
Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished
with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh
supply of open crates at his feet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of
the crates — surely not another skrewt hatching? — but when he
got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws
were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the
class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.
“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered
around. “Yeh find ’em down mines mostly. They like sparkly
stuff. . . . There yeh go, look.”
One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite
Pansy Parkinson’s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped
backward.
“Useful little treasure detectors,” said Hagrid happily. “Thought
we’d have some fun with ’em today. See over there?” He pointed at
the large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window. “I’ve buried some gold coins. I’ve
got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most. Jus’ take
off all yer valuables, an’ choose a niffler, an’ get ready ter set ’em
loose.”
Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of
habit, as it didn’t work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket.
Then he picked up a niffler. It put its long snout in Harry’s ear and
sniffed enthusiastically. It was really quite cuddly.
“Hang on,” said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, “there’s a
spare niffler here . . . who’s missin’? Where’s Hermione?”
“She had to go to the hospital wing,” said Ron.
“We’ll explain later,” Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was
listening.
It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical
Creatures. The nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as
though it were water, each scurrying back to the student who had
released it and spitting gold into their hands. Ron’s was particularly
efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.
“Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?” he asked excitedly as his
niffler dived back into the soil, splattering his robes.
“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, Ron,” said Hagrid, grinning.
“They wreck houses, nifflers. I reckon they’ve nearly got the lot,
now,” he added, pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers
continued to dive. “I on’y buried a hundred coins. Oh there y’are,
Hermione!”
Hermione was walking toward them across the lawn. Her hands
were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable. Pansy
Parkinson was watching her beadily.
“Well, let’s check how yeh’ve done!” said Hagrid. “Count yer
coins! An’ there’s no point tryin’ ter steal any, Goyle,” he added, his
beetle-black eyes narrowed. “It’s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a
few hours.”
Goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It turned
out that Ron’s niffler had been most successful, so Hagrid gave him
an enormous slab of Honeydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell
rang across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back
to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed behind to help
Hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes. Harry noticed Madame
Maxime watching them out of her carriage window.
“What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?” said Hagrid, looking concerned.
Hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that
morning, and the envelope full of bubotuber pus.
“Aaah, don’ worry,” said Hagrid gently, looking down at her. “I got
some o’ those letters an’ all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou’ me mum.
‘Yeh’re a monster an’ yeh should be put down.’ ‘Yer mother killed innocent
people an’ if you had any decency you’d jump in a lake.’ ”
“No!” said Hermione, looking shocked.
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin
wall. “They’re jus’ nutters, Hermione. Don’ open ’em if yeh get any
more. Chuck ’em straigh’ in the fire.”
“You missed a really good lesson,” Harry told Hermione as they
headed back toward the castle. “They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they,
Ron?”
Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given
him. He looked thoroughly put out about something.
“What’s the matter?” said Harry. “Wrong flavor?”
“No,” said Ron shortly. “Why didn’t you tell me about the
gold?”
“What gold?” said Harry.
“The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,” said Ron.
“The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top
Box. Why didn’t you tell me it disappeared?”
Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron
was talking about.
“Oh . . .” he said, the memory coming back to him at last. “I
dunno . . . I never noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my
wand, wasn’t I?”
They climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the
Great Hall for lunch.
“Must be nice,” Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and
started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings. “To
have so much money you don’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons
goes missing.”
“Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!” said Harry
impatiently. “We all did, remember?”
“I didn’t know leprechaun gold vanishes,” Ron muttered. “I
thought I was paying you back. You shouldn’t’ve given me that
Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas.”
“Forget it, all right?” said Harry.
Ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it.
Then he said, “I hate being poor.”
Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of them really knew what to say.
“It’s rubbish,” said Ron, still glaring down at his potato. “I don’t
blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. Wish
I could. Wish I had a niffler.”
“Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,” said Hermione brightly. Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said,
“Come on, Ron, it could be worse. At least your fingers aren’t full
of pus.” Hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her
knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen. “I hate that
Skeeter woman!” she burst out savagely. “I’ll get her back for this if
it’s the last thing I do!”
Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following
week, and although she followed Hagrid’s advice and stopped
opening it, several of her ill-wishers sent Howlers, which exploded
at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole
Hall to hear. Even those people who didn’t read Witch Weekly knew
all about the supposed Harry-Krum-Hermione triangle now.
Harry was getting sick of telling people that Hermione wasn’t his
girlfriend.
“It’ll die down, though,” he told Hermione, “if we just ignore
it. . . . People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last
time —”
“I want to know how she’s listening into private conversations
when she’s supposed to be banned from the grounds!” said
Hermione angrily.
Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark
Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class
was very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test
of hex-deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries.
Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold his hands
clamped over them as he walked away from the class.
“Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!”
Hermione panted five minutes later, catching up with Harry and
Ron in the entrance hall and pulling Harry’s hand away from one
of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her. “Moody says he didn’t
see her anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!”
“Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?” said
Ron.
“No!” said Hermione stubbornly. “I want to know how she
heard me talking to Viktor! And how she found out about Hagrid’s
mum!”
“Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry.
“Bugged?” said Ron blankly. “What . . . put fleas on her or
something?”
Harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment. Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted
them.
“Aren’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A History?”
“What’s the point?” said Ron. “You know it by heart, we can just
ask you.”
“All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things — they all go haywire
around Hogwarts, there’s too much magic in the air. No, Rita’s using magic to eavesdrop, she must be. . . . If I could just find out
what it is . . . ooh, if it’s illegal, I’ll have her . . .”
“Haven’t we got enough to worry about?” Ron asked her. “Do
we have to start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?”
“I’m not asking you to help!” Hermione snapped. “I’ll do it on
my own!”
She marched back up the marble staircase without a backward
glance. Harry was quite sure she was going to the library.
“What’s the betting she comes back with a box of I Hate Rita
Skeeter badges?” said Ron.
Hermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue vengeance against Rita Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days
before the Easter holidays. Harry frankly marveled at the fact that
Hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as
well as everything else they had to do. He was working flat-out just
to get through all their homework, though he made a point of
sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for
Sirius; after last summer, Harry had not forgotten what it felt like
to be continually hungry. He enclosed notes to Sirius, telling him
that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they were
still waiting for an answer from Percy.
Hedwig didn’t return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy’s
letter was enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley
had sent. Both Harry’s and Ron’s were the size of dragon eggs and
full of homemade toffee. Hermione’s, however, was smaller than a
chicken egg. Her face fell when she saw it.
“Your mum doesn’t read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she,
Ron?” she asked quietly.
“Yeah,” said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee. “Gets it for
the recipes.”
Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.
“Don’t you want to see what Percy’s written?” Harry asked her
hastily.
Percy’s letter was short and irritated.
As I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet, Mr. Crouch is
taking a well-deserved break. He is sending in regular owls
with instructions. No, I haven’t actually seen him, but I think
I can be trusted to know my own superior’s handwriting. I
have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to
quash these ridiculous rumors. Please don’t bother me again
unless it’s something important. Happy Easter.
The start of the summer term would normally have meant that
Harry was training hard for the last Quidditch match of the season.
This year, however, it was the third and final task in the Triwizard
Tournament for which he needed to prepare, but he still didn’t
know what he would have to do. Finally, in the last week of May,
Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration.
“You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine
o’clock, Potter,” she told him. “Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the
champions about the third task.”
So at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and Hermione in
Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs. As he crossed the entrance
hall, Cedric came up from the Hufflepuff common room.
“What d’you reckon it’s going to be?” he asked Harry as they
went together down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night.
“Fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels; she reckons
we’ve got to find treasure.”
“That wouldn’t be too bad,” said Harry, thinking that he would
simply ask Hagrid for a niftier to do the job for him.
They walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium,
turned through a gap in the stands, and walked out onto the field.
“What’ve they done to it?” Cedric said indignantly, stopping
dead.
The Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It looked as
though somebody had been building long, low walls all over it that
twisted and crisscrossed in every direction.
“They’re hedges!” said Harry, bending to examine the nearest
one.
“Hello there!” called a cheery voice.
Ludo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with
Krum and Fleur. Harry and Cedric made their way toward them,
climbing over the hedges. Fleur beamed at Harry as he came
nearer. Her attitude toward him had changed completely since he
had saved her sister from the lake.
“Well, what d’you think?” said Bagman happily as Harry and
Cedric climbed over the last hedge. “Growing nicely, aren’t they?
Give them a month and Hagrid’ll have them twenty feet high.
Don’t worry,” he added, grinning, spotting the less-than-happy
expressions on Harry’s and Cedric’s faces, “you’ll have your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over! Now, I imagine you
can guess what we’re making here?”
No one spoke for a moment. Then —
“Maze,” grunted Krum.
“That’s right!” said Bagman. “A maze. The third task’s really very
straightforward. The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of
the maze. The first champion to touch it will receive full marks.”
“We seemply ’ave to get through the maze?” said Fleur.
“There will be obstacles,” said Bagman happily, bouncing on the
balls of his feet. “Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . .
then there will be spells that must be broken . . . all that sort of
thing, you know. Now, the champions who are leading on points
will get a head start into the maze.” Bagman grinned at Harry and
Cedric. “Then Mr. Krum will enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But
you’ll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get
past the obstacles. Should be fun, eh?”
Harry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid
was likely to provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely
to be any fun at all. However, he nodded politely like the other
champions.
“Very well . . . if you haven’t got any questions, we’ll go back up
to the castle, shall we, it’s a bit chilly. . . .”
Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their
way out of the growing maze. Harry had the feeling that Bagman
was going to start offering to help him again, but just then, Krum
tapped Harry on the shoulder.
“Could I haff a vord?”
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, slightly surprised.
“Vill you valk vith me?”
“Okay,” said Harry curiously.
Bagman looked slightly perturbed.
“I’ll wait for you, Harry, shall I?”
“No, it’s okay, Mr. Bagman,” said Harry, suppressing a smile, “I
think I can find the castle on my own, thanks.”
Harry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set
a course for the Durmstrang ship. Instead, he walked toward the
forest.
“What’re we going this way for?” said Harry as they passed
Hagrid’s cabin and the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.
“Don’t vant to be overheard,” said Krum shortly.
When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short
way from the Beauxbatons horses’ paddock, Krum stopped in the
shade of the trees and turned to face Harry.
“I vant to know,” he said, glowering, “vot there is between you
and Hermy-own-ninny.”
Harry, who from Krum’s secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this, stared up at Krum in amazement.
“Nothing,” he said. But Krum glowered at him, and Harry,
somehow struck anew by how tall Krum was, elaborated. “We’re
friends. She’s not my girlfriend and she never has been. It’s just that
Skeeter woman making things up.”
“Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,” said Krum,
looking suspiciously at Harry.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “because we’re friends.”
He couldn’t quite believe he was having this conversation with
Viktor Krum, the famous International Quidditch player. It was as
though the eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an
equal — a real rival —
“You haff never . . . you haff not . . .”
“No,” said Harry very firmly.
Krum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, then said, “You fly very vell. I vos votching at the first task.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling
much taller himself. “I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The
Wronski Feint, you really —”
But something moved behind Krum in the trees, and Harry,
who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed Krum’s arm and pulled him around.
“Vot is it?”
Harry shook his head, staring at the place where he’d seen movement. He slipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.
Suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak. For a moment, Harry didn’t recognize him . . . then he realized it was Mr.
Crouch.
He looked as though he had been traveling for days. The knees
of his robes were ripped and bloody, his face scratched; he was
unshaven and gray with exhaustion. His neat hair and mustache
were both in need of a wash and a trim. His strange appearance,
however, was nothing to the way he was behaving. Muttering and
gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to be talking to someone that
he alone could see. He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he
had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man too
had been conversing wildly with thin air; Aunt Petunia had seized
Dudley’s hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him; Uncle
Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he
would like to do with beggars and vagrants.
“Vosn’t he a judge?” said Krum, staring at Mr. Crouch. “Isn’t he
vith your Ministry?”
Harry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mr. Crouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk
to a nearby tree.
“. . . and when you’ve done that, Weatherby, send an owl to
Dumbledore confirming the number of Durmstrang students who
will be attending the tournament, Karkaroff has just sent word
there will be twelve. . . .”
“Mr. Crouch?” said Harry cautiously.
“. . . and then send another owl to Madame Maxime, because
she might want to up the number of students she’s bringing, now
Karkaroff’s made it a round dozen . . . do that, Weatherby, will
you? Will you? Will . . .”
Mr. Crouch’s eyes were bulging. He stood staring at the tree,
muttering soundlessly at it. Then he staggered sideways and fell to
his knees.
“Mr. Crouch?” Harry said loudly. “Are you all right?”
Crouch’s eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked around at
Krum, who had followed him into the trees, and was looking down
at Crouch in alarm.
“Vot is wrong with him?”
“No idea,” Harry muttered. “Listen, you’d better go and get
someone —”
“Dumbledore!” gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out and seized
a handful of Harry’s robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes
were staring over Harry’s head. “I need . . . see . . . Dumbledore. . . .”
“Okay,” said Harry, “if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to
the —”
“I’ve done . . . stupid . . . thing . . .” Mr. Crouch breathed. He
looked utterly mad. His eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle
of spittle was sliding down his chin. Every word he spoke seemed
to cost him a terrible effort. “Must . . . tell . . . Dumbledore . . .”
“Get up, Mr. Crouch,” said Harry loudly and clearly. “Get up,
I’ll take you to Dumbledore!”
Mr. Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto Harry.
“Who . . . you?” he whispered.
“I’m a student at the school,” said Harry, looking around at
Krum for some help, but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous.
“You’re not . . . his?” whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.
“No,” said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was
talking about.
“Dumbledore’s?”
“That’s right,” said Harry.
Crouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch’s
grip on his robes, but it was too powerful.
“Warn . . . Dumbledore . . .”
“I’ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,” said Harry. “Just let
go, Mr. Crouch, and I’ll get him. . . .”
“Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would
like a cup of tea. My wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge.”
Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed
completely unaware that Harry was there, which surprised Harry
so much he didn’t notice that Crouch had released him.
“Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.s, most satisfactory, yes, thank you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could
bring me that memo from the Andorran Minister of Magic, I think
I will have time to draft a response. . . .”
“You stay here with him!” Harry said to Krum. “I’ll get Dumbledore, I’ll be quicker, I know where his office is —”
“He is mad,” said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch,
who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was
Percy.
“Just stay with him,” said Harry, starting to get up, but his
movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr.
Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry
back to the ground.
“Don’t . . . leave . . . me!” he whispered, his eyes bulging again.
“I . . . escaped . . . must warn . . . must tell . . . see Dumbledore . . .
my fault . . . all my fault . . . Bertha . . . dead . . . all my fault . . .
my son . . . my fault . . . tell Dumbledore . . . Harry Potter . . . the
Dark Lord . . . stronger . . . Harry Potter . . .”
“I’ll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr. Crouch!” said Harry.
He looked furiously around at Krum. “Help me, will you?”
Looking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved forward and
squatted down next to Mr. Crouch.
“Just keep him here,” said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr.
Crouch. “I’ll be back with Dumbledore.”
“Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after him as Harry sprinted
away from the forest and up through the dark grounds. They were
deserted; Bagman, Cedric, and Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore
up the stone steps, through the oak front doors, and off up the
marble staircase, toward the second floor.
Five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle
standing halfway along an empty corridor.
“Sher — sherbet lemon!” he panted at it.
This was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore’s
office — or at least, it had been two years ago. The password had
evidently changed, however, for the stone gargoyle did not spring
to life and jump aside, but stood frozen, glaring at Harry
malevolently.
“Move!” Harry shouted at it. “C’mon!”
But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he
shouted at it; he knew it was no good. He looked up and down the
dark corridor. Perhaps Dumbledore was in the staffroom? He
started running as fast as he could toward the staircase —
“POTTER!”
Harry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape had just
emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle. The
wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned Harry back
toward him.
“What are you doing here, Potter?”
“I need to see Professor Dumbledore!” said Harry, running back
up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead. “It’s Mr. Crouch . . . he’s just turned up . . . he’s in the forest . . . he’s asking —”
“What is this rubbish?” said Snape, his black eyes glittering.
“What are you talking about?”
“Mr. Crouch!” Harry shouted. “From the Ministry! He’s ill or
something — he’s in the forest, he wants to see Dumbledore! Just
give me the password up to —”
“The headmaster is busy, Potter,” said Snape, his thin mouth
curling into an unpleasant smile.
“I’ve got to tell Dumbledore!” Harry yelled.
“Didn’t you hear me, Potter?”
Harry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying Harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky.
“Look,” said Harry angrily, “Crouch isn’t right — he’s — he’s
out of his mind — he says he wants to warn —”
The stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore was standing there, wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression.
“Is there a problem?” he said, looking between Harry and Snape.
“Professor!” Harry said, sidestepping Snape before Snape could
speak, “Mr. Crouch is here — he’s down in the forest, he wants to
speak to you!”
Harry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to his relief,
Dumbledore did nothing of the sort.
“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off along the
corridor behind Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle
and looking twice as ugly.
“What did Mr. Crouch say, Harry?” said Dumbledore as they
walked swiftly down the marble staircase.
“Said he wants to warn you . . . said he’s done something
terrible . . . he mentioned his son . . . and Bertha Jorkins . . .
and — and Voldemort . . . something about Voldemort getting
stronger. . . .”
“Indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they
hurried out into the pitch-darkness.
“He’s not acting normally,” Harry said, hurrying along beside
Dumbledore. “He doesn’t seem to know where he is. He keeps
talking like he thinks Percy Weasley’s there, and then he
changes, and says he needs to see you. . . . I left him with Viktor Krum.”
“You did?” said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take
longer strides still, so that Harry was running to keep up. “Do you
know if anybody else saw Mr. Crouch?”
“No,” said Harry. “Krum and I were talking, Mr. Bagman had
just finished telling us about the third task, we stayed behind, and
then we saw Mr. Crouch coming out of the forest —”
“Where are they?” said Dumbledore as the Beauxbatons carriage
emerged from the darkness.
“Over here,” said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way through the trees. He couldn’t hear Crouch’s voice anymore, but he knew where he was going; it hadn’t been much past
the Beauxbatons carriage . . . somewhere around here. . . .
“Viktor?” Harry shouted.
No one answered.
“They were here,” Harry said to Dumbledore. “They were definitely somewhere around here. . . .”
“Lumos,” Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up.
Its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the ground. And then it fell upon a pair of feet.
Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was sprawled on
the forest floor. He seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at
 all of Mr. Crouch. Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted
one of his eyelids.
“Stunned,” he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the
wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees.
“Should I go and get someone?” said Harry. “Madam Pomfrey?”
“No,” said Dumbledore swiftly. “Stay here.”
He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of
Hagrid’s cabin. Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and
streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered, “Rennervate.”
Krum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Dumbledore, he tried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.
“He attacked me!” Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his
head. “The old madman attacked me! I vos looking around to see
vare Potter had gone and he attacked from behind!”
“Lie still for a moment,” Dumbledore said.
The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid
came panting into sight with Fang at his heels. He was carrying his
crossbow.
“Professor Dumbledore!” he said, his eyes widening. “Harry —
what the — ?”
“Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,” said Dumbledore. “His student has been attacked. When you’ve done that,
kindly alert Professor Moody —”
“No need, Dumbledore,” said a wheezy growl. “I’m here.”
Moody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff, his
wand lit.
“Damn leg,” he said furiously. “Would’ve been here quicker . . .
what’s happened? Snape said something about Crouch —”
“Crouch?” said Hagrid blankly.
“Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!” said Dumbledore sharply.
“Oh yeah . . . right y’are, Professor . . .” said Hagrid, and he
turned and disappeared into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.
“I don’t know where Barty Crouch is,” Dumbledore told
Moody, “but it is essential that we find him.”
“I’m onto it,” growled Moody, and he pulled out his wand and
limped off into the forest.
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the
unmistakable sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning. Karkaroff was
hurrying along behind them. He was wearing his sleek silver furs,
and he looked pale and agitated.
“What is this?” he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and
Dumbledore and Harry beside him. “What’s going on?”
“I vos attacked!” said Krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head.
“Mr. Crouch or votever his name —”
“Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The Triwizard
judge?”
“Igor,” Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself
up, clutching his furs around him, looking livid.
“Treachery!” he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. “It is a plot!
You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false
pretenses, Dumbledore! This is not an equal competition! First you
sneak Potter into the tournament, though he is underage! Now one
of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of
action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair,
and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international

  
wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences — here’s what I think of you!”
Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore’s feet. In one
swift movement, Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff’s furs, lifted
him into the air, and slammed him against a nearby tree.
“Apologize!” Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath,
Hagrid’s massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.
“Hagrid, no!” Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.
Hagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and
Karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle
at its roots; a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head.
“Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore sharply.
Breathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look.
“Maybe I’d better stay here, Headmaster. . . .”
“You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,” Dumbledore repeated firmly. “Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And
Harry — I want you to stay there. Anything you might want to
do — any owls you might want to send — they can wait until
morning, do you understand me?”
“Er — yes,” said Harry, staring at him. How had Dumbledore
known that, at that very moment, he had been thinking about
sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius, to tell him what had
happened?
“I’ll leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,” Hagrid said, staring
menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the
tree, tangled in furs and tree roots. “Stay, Fang. C’mon, Harry.”
They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up
toward the castle.
“How dare he,” Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake.
“How dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore’d do anythin’
like that. Like Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the
firs’ place. Worried! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he’s bin lately. An’ you!” Hagrid suddenly said angrily to
Harry, who looked up at him, taken aback. “What were yeh doin’,
wanderin’ off with ruddy Krum? He’s from Durmstrang, Harry!
Coulda jinxed yeh right there, couldn’ he? Hasn’ Moody taught yeh
nothin’? ’Magine lettin’ him lure yeh off on yer own —”
“Krum’s all right!” said Harry as they climbed the steps into the
entrance hall. “He wasn’t trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk
about Hermione —”
“I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all,” said Hagrid grimly,
stomping up the stairs. “The less you lot ’ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh’ll be. Yeh can’ trust any of ’em.”
“You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,” Harry
said, annoyed.
“Don’ you talk ter me abou’ her!” said Hagrid, and he looked
quite frightening for a moment. “I’ve got her number now! Tryin’
ter get back in me good books, tryin’ ter get me ter tell her what’s
comin’ in the third task. Ha! You can’ trust any of ’em!”
Hagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say
good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through
the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for
the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting, to tell them
what had happened.

It comes down to this,” said Hermione, rubbing her forehead.
“Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn’t looking.”
“It must’ve been Crouch,” said Ron at once. “That’s why he
was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He’d done a
runner.”
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shaking his head. “He seemed
really weak — I don’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.”
“You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven’t I told
you enough times?” said Hermione.
“Okay . . . how’s this for a theory,” said Ron excitedly. “Krum
attacked Crouch — no, wait for it — and then Stunned himself!”
“And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?” said Hermione coldly.
“Oh yeah . . .”

  
It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of
their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together
to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the
misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because
they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch.
“Just go through it again, Harry,” said Hermione. “What did
Mr. Crouch actually say?”
“I’ve told you, he wasn’t making much sense,” said Harry. “He
said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was
dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son.”
“Well, that was his fault,” said Hermione testily.
“He was out of his mind,” said Harry. “Half the time he seemed
to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to
Percy about work and giving him instructions.”
“And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?” said
Ron tentatively.
“I’ve told you,” Harry repeated dully. “He said he’s getting
stronger.”
There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice,
“But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. . . .”
“He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,”
said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. “He was
having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was
when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted
to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.”
Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the

  
rafters. The many perches were half-empty; every now and then,
another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night’s hunting with a mouse in its beak.
“If Snape hadn’t held me up,” Harry said bitterly, “we might’ve
got there in time. ‘The headmaster is busy, Potter . . . what’s this
rubbish, Potter?’ Why couldn’t he have just got out of the way?”
“Maybe he didn’t want you to get there!” said Ron quickly.
“Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon he could’ve gotten
down to the forest? D’you reckon he could’ve beaten you and
Dumbledore there?”
“Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,” said
Harry.
“Wouldn’t put it past him,” Ron muttered.
“We need to see Professor Moody,” said Hermione. “We need to
find out whether he found Mr. Crouch.”
“If he had the Marauder’s Map on him, it would’ve been easy,”
said Harry.
“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,” said Ron,
“because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn’t —”
“Shh!” said Hermione suddenly.
Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry
could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.
“— that’s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for
that —”
“— we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like him. He
wouldn’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did —”
“I’m telling you, if you put that in writing, it’s blackmail!”
“Yeah, and you won’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff,
will you?”

  
The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the
threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
“What’re you doing here?” Ron and Fred said at the same time.
“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.
“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred.
Fred grinned.
“Fine — we won’t ask you what you’re doing, if you don’t ask
us,” he said.
He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at
it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand
so that the name on it was covered.
“Well, don’t let us hold you up,” Fred said, making a mock bow
and pointing at the door.
Ron didn’t move. “Who’re you blackmailing?” he said.
The grin vanished from Fred’s face. Harry saw George half
glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron.
“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.
“Didn’t sound like that,” said Ron.
Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly,
“I’ve told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the
shape it is. Can’t see why you would, but —”
“It’s my business if you’re blackmailing someone,” said Ron.
“George’s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.”
“Told you, I was joking,” said George. He walked over to Fred,
pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg
of the nearest barn owl. “You’re starting to sound a bit like our dear
older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you’ll be made a
prefect.”
“No, I won’t!” said Ron hotly.

  
George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off.
George turned around and grinned at Ron.
“Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later.”
He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared
at one another.
“You don’t think they know something about all this, do you?”
Hermione whispered. “About Crouch and everything?”
“No,” said Harry. “If it was something that serious, they’d tell
someone. They’d tell Dumbledore.”
Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.
“What’s the matter?” Hermione asked him.
“Well . . .” said Ron slowly, “I dunno if they would. They’re . . .
they’re obsessed with making money lately, I noticed it when I was
hanging around with them — when — you know —”
“We weren’t talking.” Harry finished the sentence for him.
“Yeah, but blackmail . . .”
“It’s this joke shop idea they’ve got,” said Ron. “I thought
they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean
it, they want to start one. They’ve only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it’s time to think about their
future, and Dad can’t help them, and they need gold to get
started.”
Hermione was looking uncomfortable now.
“Yes, but . . . they wouldn’t do anything against the law to get
gold.”
“Wouldn’t they?” said Ron, looking skeptical. “I dunno . . . they
don’t exactly mind breaking rules, do they?”
“Yes, but this is the law,” said Hermione, looking scared.
“This isn’t some silly school rule. . . . They’ll get a lot more than

  
detention for blackmail! Ron . . . maybe you’d better tell
Percy. . . .”
“Are you mad?” said Ron. “Tell Percy? He’d probably do a Crouch
and turn them in.” He stared at the window through which Fred
and Georges owl had departed, then said, “Come on, let’s get some
breakfast.”
“D’you think it’s too early to go and see Professor Moody?”
Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase.
“Yes,” said Harry. “He’d probably blast us through the door if we
wake him at the crack of dawn; he’ll think we’re trying to attack
him while he’s asleep. Let’s give it till break.”
History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking
Ron’s watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron’s was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All
three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads
down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn’t taking her
usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at
Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.
When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors
toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye
was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance
than usual.
“Professor Moody?” Harry called as they made their way toward
him through the crowd.
“Hello, Potter,” growled Moody. His magical eye followed a
couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it
rolled into the back of Moody’s head and watched them around the
corner before he spoke again.

  
“Come in here.”
He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in
after them, and closed the door.
“Did you find him?” Harry asked without preamble. “Mr.
Crouch?”
“No,” said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down,
stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his
hip flask.
“Did you use the map?” Harry said.
“Of course,” said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. “Took a
leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the
forest. He wasn’t anywhere on there.”
“So he did Disapparate?” said Ron.
“You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!” said Hermione.
“There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren’t there,
Professor?”
Moody’s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. “You’re
another one who might think about a career as an Auror,” he told
her. “Mind works the right way, Granger.”
Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.
“Well, he wasn’t invisible,” said Harry. “The map shows invisible people. He must’ve left the grounds, then.”
“But under his own steam?” said Hermione eagerly, “or because
someone made him?”
“Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a broom
and flown off with him, couldn’t they?” said Ron quickly, looking
hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.
“We can’t rule out kidnap,” growled Moody.

  
“So,” said Ron, “d’you reckon he’s somewhere in Hogsmeade?”
“Could be anywhere,” said Moody, shaking his head. “Only
thing we know for sure is that he’s not here.”
He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided
mouth revealed a number of missing teeth. Then he said, “Now,
Dumbledore’s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators,
but there’s nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry’ll be looking for him now, Dumbledore’s notified them. Potter, you just keep
your mind on the third task.”
“What?” said Harry. “Oh yeah . . .”
He hadn’t given the maze a single thought since he’d left it with
Krum the previous night.
“Should be right up your street, this one,” said Moody, looking
up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. “From
what Dumbledore’s said, you’ve managed to get through stuff like
this plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles
guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone in your first year, didn’t you?”
“We helped,” Ron said quickly. “Me and Hermione helped.”
Moody grinned.
“Well, help him practice for this one, and I’ll be very surprised if
he doesn’t win,” said Moody. “In the meantime . . . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance.” He took another long draw
from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window.
The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it.
“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and
Hermione, “you stick close to Potter, all right? I’m keeping an eye on
things, but all the same . . . you can never have too many eyes out.”
* * *

  
Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down
beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front
of Hermione, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She
took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, “Ha! She hasn’t got wind of Crouch!” then joined Ron and Harry in reading
what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before
last.
Harry — what do you think you are playing at, walking
off into the forest with Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by
return owl, that you are not going to go walking with anyone
else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts.
It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing
Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in
the dark. You could have been killed.
Your name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If
someone’s trying to attack you, they’re on their last chance. Stay
close to Ron and Hermione, do not leave Gryffindor Tower
after hours, and arm yourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and Disarming. A few hexes wouldn’t go amiss either.
There’s nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your head
down and look after yourself. I’m waiting for your letter giving
me your word you won’t stray out-of-bounds again.
“Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?” said
Harry in mild indignation as he folded up Sirius’s letter and put it
inside his robes. “After all the stuff he did at school!”

  
“He’s worried about you!” said Hermione sharply. “Just like
Moody and Hagrid! So listen to them!”
“No one’s tried to attack me all year,” said Harry. “No one’s done
anything to me at all —”
“Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,” said Hermione.
“And they must’ve done that for a reason, Harry. Snuffles is right.
Maybe they’ve been biding their time. Maybe this is the task they’re
going to get you.”
“Look,” said Harry impatiently, “let’s say Sirius is right, and
someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would’ve
been in the trees near us, wouldn’t they? But they waited till I was
out of the way until they acted, didn’t they? So it doesn’t look like
I’m their target, does it?”
“They couldn’t have made it look like an accident if they’d murdered you in the forest!” said Hermione. “But if you die during a
task —”
“They didn’t care about attacking Krum, did they?” said Harry.
“Why didn’t they just polish me off at the same time? They
could’ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something.”
“Harry, I don’t understand it either,” said Hermione desperately.
“I just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don’t like
it. . . . Moody’s right — Sirius is right — you’ve got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write
back to Sirius and promise him you’re not going to go sneaking off
alone again.”
The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when
Harry had to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his

  
free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up
hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to
practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he
had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved
certain sacrifices on Ron’s and Hermione’s part.
“Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?” Ron suggested on Monday
lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms
classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for
the fifth time in a row. “Let’s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use
Dobby, Harry, I bet he’d do anything to help you. I’m not complaining or anything” — he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his
backside — “but I’m aching all over. . . .”
“Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you!” said Hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for
the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. “Just try
and fall backward!”
“Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, Hermione!” said
Ron angrily. “Why don’t you take a turn?”
“Well, I think Harry’s got it now, anyway,” said Hermione
hastily. “And we don’t have to worry about Disarming, because he’s
been able to do that for ages. . . . I think we ought to start on some
of these hexes this evening.”
She looked down the list they had made in the library.
“I like the look of this one,” she said, “this Impediment Curse.
Should slow down anything that’s trying to attack you, Harry.
We’ll start with that one.”
The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into
Flitwick’s cupboard and slipped out of the classroom.

  
“See you at dinner!” said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and
Divination. Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight fell across the
corridor from the high windows. The sky outside was so brightly
blue it looked as though it had been enameled.
“It’s going to be boiling in Trelawney’s room, she never puts out
that fire,” said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver
ladder and the trapdoor.
He was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot.
The fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harry’s
head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and
settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played
across his face. It was extremely comfortable.
“My dears,” said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her
winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them
all with her strangely enlarged eyes, “we have almost finished our
work on planetary divination. Today, however, will be an excellent
opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is placed most
interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way, I will
dim the lights. . . .”
She waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire was the
only source of light now. Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted,
from under her chair, a miniature model of the solar system,
contained within a glass dome. It was a beautiful thing; each of
the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the
fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass. Harry

  
watched lazily as Professor Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making to Neptune. The heavily perfumed
fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window played
across his face. He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain. His eyelids began to droop. . . .
He was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the
clear blue sky toward an old, ivy-covered house set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in
Harry’s face, until they reached a dark and broken window in the
upper story of the house and entered. Now they were flying along
a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end . . . through the
door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded
up. . . .
Harry had left the owl’s back . . . he was watching, now, as it
fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to him. . . .
There were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair . . . both
of them were stirring. . . .
One was a huge snake . . . the other was a man . . . a short, balding man, a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose . . . he was
wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug. . . .
“You are in luck, Wormtail,” said a cold, high-pitched voice
from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed. “You are
very fortunate indeed. Your blunder has not ruined everything. He
is dead.”
“My Lord!” gasped the man on the floor. “My Lord, I am . . . I
am so pleased . . . and so sorry. . . .”
“Nagini,” said the cold voice, “you are out of luck. I will not be
feeding Wormtail to you, after all . . . but never mind, never
mind . . . there is still Harry Potter. . . .”

  
The snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.
“Now, Wormtail,” said the cold voice, “perhaps one more little
reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you. . . .”
“My Lord . . . no . . . I beg you . . .”
The tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. It
was pointing at Wormtail.
“Crucio!” said the cold voice.
Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body
were on fire, the screaming filled Harry’s ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he was yelling too. . . . Voldemort would
hear him, would know he was there. . . .
“Harry! Harry!”
Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor
Trelawney’s room with his hands over his face. His scar was still
burning so badly that his eyes were watering. The pain had been
real. The whole class was standing around him, and Ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified.
“You all right?” he said.
“Of course he isn’t!” said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him.
“What was it, Potter? A premonition? An apparition? What did
you see?”
“Nothing,” Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking.
He couldn’t stop himself from looking around, into the shadows
behind him; Voldemort’s voice had sounded so close. . . .
“You were clutching your scar!” said Professor Trelawney. “You
were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now, Potter, I
have experience in these matters!”
Harry looked up at her.

  
“I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,” he said. “Bad
headache.”
“My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!” said Professor Trelawney
“If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than
you have ever —”
“I don’t want to see anything except a headache cure,” said
Harry.
He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved.
“See you later,” Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his
bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney,
who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she
had just been denied a real treat.
When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he
did not set off for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever
of going there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him
again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going
straight to Dumbledore’s office. He marched down the corridors,
thinking about what he had seen in the dream . . . it had been as vivid
as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive. . . . He ran over the
details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them. . . .
He had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder . . .
but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired,
somebody was dead . . . so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the
snake . . . he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead. . . .
Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore’s office without noticing. He blinked,
looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps,

  
stopping in front of it. Then he remembered that he didn’t know
the password.
“Sherbet lemon?” he tried tentatively.
The gargoyle did not move.
“Okay,” said Harry, staring at it, “Pear Drop. Er — Licorice
Wand. Fizzing Whizbee. Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum. Bertie
Bott’s Every Flavor Beans . . . oh no, he doesn’t like them, does
he? . . . oh just open, can’t you?” he said angrily. “I really need to
see him, it’s urgent!”
The gargoyle remained immovable.
Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in
his big toe.
“Chocolate Frog!” he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. “Sugar
Quill! Cockroach Cluster!”
The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked.
“Cockroach Cluster?” he said, amazed. “I was only joking. . . .”
He hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the
foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the
doors closed behind him, taking him up to a polished oak door
with a brass door knocker.
He could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the
moving staircase and hesitated, listening.
“Dumbledore, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection, don’t see it
at all!” It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge.
“Ludo says Bertha’s perfectly capable of getting herself lost. I agree
we would have expected to have found her by now, but all the
same, we’ve no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all. As
for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch’s!”

  
“And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?”
said Moody’s growling voice.
“I see two possibilities, Alastor,” said Fudge. “Either Crouch has
finally cracked — more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given his
personal history — lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere —”
“He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,”
said Dumbledore calmly.
“Or else — well . . .” Fudge sounded embarrassed. “Well, I’ll
reserve judgment until after I’ve seen the place where he was found,
but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore,
you know what that woman is?”
“I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent dancer,” said Dumbledore quietly.
“Dumbledore, come!” said Fudge angrily. “Don’t you think you
might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid? They don’t all
turn out harmless — if, indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with
that monster fixation he’s got —”
“I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, just as calmly. “I think it possible that it is you who are
prejudiced, Cornelius.”
“Can we wrap up this discussion?” growled Moody.
“Yes, yes, let’s go down to the grounds, then,” said Fudge impatiently.
“No, it’s not that,” said Moody, “it’s just that Potter wants a
word with you, Dumbledore. He’s just outside the door.”

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y
THE PENSIEV E

The door of the office opened.
“Hello, Potter,” said Moody. “Come in, then.”
Harry walked inside. He had been inside Dumbledore’s office
once before; it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all
of whom were fast asleep, their chests rising and falling gently.
Cornelius Fudge was standing beside Dumbledore’s desk, wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding his lime-green bowler
hat.
“Harry!” said Fudge jovially, moving forward. “How are you?”
“Fine,” Harry lied.
“We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned
up on the grounds,” said Fudge. “It was you who found him, was
it not?”
“Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that
he hadn’t overheard what they had been saying, he added, “I didn’t
T

  
see Madame Maxime anywhere, though, and she’d have a job hiding, wouldn’t she?”
Dumbledore smiled at Harry behind Fudge’s back, his eyes
twinkling.
“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re about to go
for a short walk on the grounds, Harry, if you’ll excuse us . . . perhaps if you just go back to your class —”
“I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” Harry said quickly, looking
at Dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look.
“Wait here for me, Harry,” he said. “Our examination of the
grounds will not take long.”
They trooped out in silence past him and closed the door. After
a minute or so, Harry heard the clunks of Moody’s wooden leg
growing fainter in the corridor below. He looked around.
“Hello, Fawkes,” he said.
Fawkes, Professor Dumbledore’s phoenix, was standing on his
golden perch beside the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent
scarlet-and-gold plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked
benignly at Harry.
Harry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore’s desk. For
several minutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had
just heard, and running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped
hurting now.
He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore’s office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the
dream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk. The patched
and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to
it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt,

  
which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the
Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to
Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,
remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all
hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and
shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source of
the light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly from
within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been
closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up,
walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.
A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the
edge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery
light was coming from the basin’s contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was
moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly.
It looked like light made liquid — or like wind made solid —
Harry couldn’t make up his mind.
He wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly
four years’ experience of the magical world told him that sticking
his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very
stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wand out of the inside
of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at
the contents of the basin, and prodded them.
The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl
very fast.
Harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery
substance had become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked

  
down into it, expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin — and
saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious
substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a
circular window in the ceiling.
The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets
such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering
his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were
seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in
levels. An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There
was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling.
Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.
Where was this place? It surely wasn’t Hogwarts; he had never
seen a room like that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the
mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of
adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at
Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something;
even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their
faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them
were talking to one another.
The basin being circular, and the room he was observing square,
Harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it.
He leaned even closer, tilting his head, trying to see . . .
The tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he
was staring.
Dumbledore’s office gave an almighty lurch — Harry was

  
thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the
basin —
But his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling
through something icy-cold and black; it was like being sucked
into a dark whirlpool —
And suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end
of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others.
He looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring, but there was
nothing there but dark, solid stone.
Breathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him. Not one of
the witches and wizards in the room (and there were at least two
hundred of them) was looking at him. Not one of them seemed to
have noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy had just dropped from
the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard next to him
on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated
around the silent room.
He was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.
“Professor!” Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper. “I’m
sorry — I didn’t mean to — I was just looking at that basin in your
cabinet — I — where are we?”
But Dumbledore didn’t move or speak. He ignored Harry completely. Like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into
the far corner of the room, where there was a door.
Harry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then around at the
silently watchful crowd, then back at Dumbledore. And then it
dawned on him. . . .
Once before, Harry had found himself somewhere that nobody

  
could see or hear him. That time, he had fallen through a page in
an enchanted diary, right into somebody else’s memory . . . and
unless he was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again. . . .
Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in front of Dumbledore’s face. Dumbledore did not blink,
look around at Harry, or indeed move at all. And that, in Harry’s
opinion, settled the matter. Dumbledore wouldn’t ignore him like
that. He was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day
Dumbledore. Yet it couldn’t be that long ago . . . the Dumbledore
sitting next to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day
Dumbledore. But what was this place? What were all these wizards
waiting for?
Harry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had suspected when observing it from above, was almost certainly underground — more of a dungeon than a room, he thought. There was
a bleak and forbidding air about the place; there were no pictures
on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows of
benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that
they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms.
Before Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in
which they were, he heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the
dungeon opened and three people entered — or at least one man,
flanked by two dementors.
Harry’s insides went cold. The dementors — tall, hooded creatures whose faces were concealed — were gliding slowly toward
the chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man’s
arms with their dead and rotten-looking hands. The man between
them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn’t

  
blame him . . . he knew the dementors could not touch him inside
a memory, but he remembered their power only too well. The
watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man
in the chained chair and glided back out of the room. The door
swung shut behind them.
Harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw
that it was Karkaroff.
Unlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair
and goatee were black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin
and ragged robes. He was shaking. Even as Harry watched, the
chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked
their way up Karkaroff’s arms, binding him there.
“Igor Karkaroff,” said a curt voice to Harry’s left. Harry looked
around and saw Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the
bench beside him. Crouch’s hair was dark, his face was much less
lined, he looked fit and alert. “You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You have given
us to understand that you have important information for us.”
Karkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to
the chair.
“I have, sir,” he said, and although his voice was very scared,
Harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it. “I wish to be
of use to the Ministry. I wish to help. I — I know that the Ministry
is trying to — to round up the last of the Dark Lord’s supporters. I
am eager to assist in any way I can. . . .”
There was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wizards
and witches were surveying Karkaroff with interest, others with
pronounced mistrust. Then Harry heard, quite distinctly, from
Dumbledore’s other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, “Filth.”

  
Harry leaned forward so that he could see past Dumbledore.
Mad-Eye Moody was sitting there — except that there was a very
noticeable difference in his appearance. He did not have his magical eye, but two normal ones. Both were looking down upon
Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.
“Crouch is going to let him out,” Moody breathed quietly to
Dumbledore. “He’s done a deal with him. Took me six months to
track him down, and Crouch is going to let him go if he’s got
enough new names. Let’s hear his information, I say, and throw
him straight back to the dementors.”
Dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long,
crooked nose.
“Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don’t like the dementors, do you,
Albus?” said Moody with a sardonic smile.
“No,” said Dumbledore calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t. I have long
felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.”
“But for filth like this . . .” Moody said softly.
“You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,” said Mr. Crouch.
“Let us hear them, please.”
“You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly, “that He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . .
He preferred that we — I mean to say, his supporters — and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever counted myself among them —”
“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.
“— we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He
alone knew exactly who we all were —”
“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented someone like
you, Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,” muttered Moody.
“Yet you say you have some names for us?” said Mr. Crouch.

  
“I — I do,” said Karkaroff breathlessly. “And these were important supporters, mark you. People I saw with my own eyes doing his
bidding. I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely —”
“These names are?” said Mr. Crouch sharply.
Karkaroff drew a deep breath.
“There was Antonin Dolohov,” he said. “I — I saw him torture
countless Muggles and — and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.”
“And helped him do it,” murmured Moody.
“We have already apprehended Dolohov,” said Crouch. “He was
caught shortly after yourself.”
“Indeed?” said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. “I — I am delighted to hear it!”
But he didn’t look it. Harry could tell that this news had come
as a real blow to him. One of his names was worthless.
“Any others?” said Crouch coldly.
“Why, yes . . . there was Rosier,” said Karkaroff hurriedly. “Evan
Rosier.”
“Rosier is dead,” said Crouch. “He was caught shortly after you
were too. He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was
killed in the struggle.”
“Took a bit of me with him, though,” whispered Moody to
Harry’s right. Harry looked around at him once more, and saw him
indicating the large chunk out of his nose to Dumbledore.
“No — no more than Rosier deserved!” said Karkaroff, a real
note of panic in his voice now. Harry could see that he was starting
to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the
Ministry. Karkaroff’s eyes darted toward the door in the corner, behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood, waiting.

  
“Any more?” said Crouch.
“Yes!” said Karkaroff. “There was Travers — he helped murder
the McKinnons! Mulciber — he specialized in the Imperius Curse,
forced countless people to do horrific things! Rookwood, who was
a spy, and passed He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself!”
Harry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck gold. The
watching crowd was all murmuring together.
“Rookwood?” said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in
front of him, who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment.
“Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries?”
“The very same,” said Karkaroff eagerly. “I believe he used a network of well-placed wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to
collect information —”
“But Travers and Mulciber we have,” said Mr. Crouch. “Very
well, Karkaroff, if that is all, you will be returned to Azkaban while
we decide —”
“Not yet!” cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate. “Wait, I have
more!”
Harry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin
contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard.
“Snape!” he shouted. “Severus Snape!”
“Snape has been cleared by this council,” said Crouch disdainfully. “He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore.”
“No!” shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound him
to the chair. “I assure you! Severus Snape is a Death Eater!”
Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.
“I have given evidence already on this matter,” he said calmly.
“Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined

  
our side before Lord Voldemort’s downfall and turned spy for us, at
great personal risk. He is now no more a Death Eater than I am.”
Harry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was wearing a look
of deep skepticism behind Dumbledore’s back.
“Very well, Karkaroff,” Crouch said coldly, “you have been of assistance. I shall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the
meantime. . . .”
Mr. Crouch’s voice faded. Harry looked around; the dungeon
was dissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was
fading; he could see only his own body — all else was swirling
darkness. . . .
And then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a different
seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr.
Crouch. The atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even
cheerful. The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking
to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting
event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite. She had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and
was sucking the end of an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a
younger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes. Mr. Crouch looked
more tired and somehow fiercer, gaunter. . . . Harry understood. It
was a different memory, a different day . . . a different trial.
The door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into
the room.
This was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo
Bagman who was clearly at the height of his Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn’t broken now; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair,

  
but it did not bind him there as it had bound Karkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taking heart from this, glanced around at the watching crowd, waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile.
“Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front of the
Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities
of the Death Eaters,” said Mr. Crouch. “We have heard the evidence
against you, and are about to reach our verdict. Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment?”
Harry couldn’t believe his ears. Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater?
“Only,” said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, “well — I know I’ve
been a bit of an idiot —”
One or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled
indulgently. Mr. Crouch did not appear to share their feelings. He
was staring down at Ludo Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike.
“You never spoke a truer word, boy,” someone muttered dryly to
Dumbledore behind Harry. He looked around and saw Moody
sitting there again. “If I didn’t know he’d always been dim, I’d have
said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his
brain. . . .”
“Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord
Voldemort’s supporters,” said Mr. Crouch. “For this, I suggest a
term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than —”
But there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches.
Several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even their fists, at Mr. Crouch.
“But I’ve told you, I had no idea!” Bagman called earnestly over
the crowd’s babble, his round blue eyes widening. “None at all! Old
Rookwood was a friend of my dad’s . . . never crossed my mind he

  
was in with You-Know-Who! I thought I was collecting information for our side! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a
job in the Ministry later on . . . once my Quidditch days are over,
you know . . . I mean, I can’t keep getting hit by Bludgers for the
rest of my life, can I?”
There were titters from the crowd.
“It will be put to the vote,” said Mr. Crouch coldly. He turned
to the right-hand side of the dungeon. “The jury will please raise
their hands . . . those in favor of imprisonment . . .”
Harry looked toward the right-hand side of the dungeon. Not
one person raised their hand. Many of the witches and wizards
around the walls began to clap. One of the witches on the jury
stood up.
“Yes?” barked Crouch.
“We’d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last
Saturday,” the witch said breathlessly.
Mr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now. Bagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming.
“Despicable,” Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting down as
Bagman walked out of the dungeon. “Rookwood get him a job indeed. . . . The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed
for the Ministry. . . .”
And the dungeon dissolved again. When it had returned, Harry
looked around. He and Dumbledore were still sitting beside Mr.
Crouch, but the atmosphere could not have been more different.
There was total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a frail,
wispy-looking witch in the seat next to Mr. Crouch. She was
clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands.

  
Harry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and
grayer than ever before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.
“Bring them in,” he said, and his voice echoed through the silent
dungeon.
The door in the corner opened yet again. Six dementors entered
this time, flanking a group of four people. Harry saw the people in
the crowd turn to look up at Mr. Crouch. A few of them whispered
to one another.
The dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs
with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor. There was
a thickset man who stared blankly up at Crouch; a thinner and
more nervous-looking man, whose eyes were darting around the
crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and heavily hooded
eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a
throne; and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of
petrified. He was shivering, his straw-colored hair all over his face,
his freckled skin milk-white. The wispy little witch beside Crouch
began to rock backward and forward in her seat, whimpering into
her handkerchief.
Crouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in front of
him, and there was pure hatred in his face.
“You have been brought here before the Council of Magical
Law,” he said clearly, “so that we may pass judgment on you, for a
crime so heinous —”
“Father,” said the boy with the straw-colored hair. “Father . . .
please . . .”
“— that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court,”
said Crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning out his son’s voice.

  
“We have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand
accused of capturing an Auror — Frank Longbottom — and
subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him to have
knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, HeWho-Must-Not-Be-Named —”
“Father, I didn’t!” shrieked the boy in chains below. “I didn’t, I
swear it, Father, don’t send me back to the dementors —”
“You are further accused,” bellowed Mr. Crouch, “of using the
Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom’s wife, when he would not
give you information. You planned to restore He-Who-Must-NotBe-Named to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury —”
“Mother!” screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch
beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward.
“Mother, stop him, Mother, I didn’t do it, it wasn’t me!”
“I now ask the jury,” shouted Mr. Crouch, “to raise their hands
if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in
Azkaban!”
In unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of
the dungeon raised their hands. The crowd around the walls began
to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The
boy began to scream.
“No! Mother, no! I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t know!
Don’t send me there, don’t let him!”
The dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys’ three
companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the
heavy-lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called, “The Dark Lord
will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He

  
will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any
of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to
find him!”
But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though
Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him.
The crowd was jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman
swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.
“I’m your son!” he screamed up at Crouch. “I’m your son!”
“You are no son of mine!” bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes
bulging suddenly. “I have no son!”
The wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in
her seat. She had fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed.
“Take them away!” Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying
from his mouth. “Take them away, and may they rot there!”
“Father! Father, I wasn’t involved! No! No! Father, please!”
“I think, Harry, it is time to return to my office,” said a quiet
voice in Harry’s ear.
Harry started. He looked around. Then he looked on his other
side.
There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching
Crouch’s son being dragged away by the dementors — and there
was an Albus Dumbledore on his left, looking right at him.
“Come,” said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand
under Harry’s elbow. Harry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him; for a moment, all was blackness, and
then he felt as though he had done a slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light
of Dumbledore’s sunlit office. The stone basin was shimmering in

  
the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing
beside him.
“Professor,” Harry gasped, “I know I shouldn’t’ve — I didn’t
mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and —”
“I quite understand,” said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat
down in the chair behind it. He motioned for Harry to sit down
opposite him.
Harry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their original, silvery-white state, swirling and rippling
beneath his gaze.
“What is it?” Harry asked shakily.
“This? It is called a Pensieve,” said Dumbledore. “I sometimes
find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too
many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind.”
“Er,” said Harry, who couldn’t truthfully say that he had ever felt
anything of the sort.
“At these times,” said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin,
“I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from
one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s
leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”
“You mean . . . that stuff’s your thoughts?” Harry said, staring at
the swirling white substance in the basin.
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Let me show you.”
Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and
placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he
took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it — but then

  
Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange
silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve. Dumbledore added
this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw his own
face swimming around the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed
his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather
as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold . . . and
Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape’s, who opened
his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.
“It’s coming back . . . Karkaroff’s too . . . stronger and clearer
than ever . . .”
“A connection I could have made without assistance,” Dumbledore sighed, “but never mind.” He peered over the top of his halfmoon spectacles at Harry, who was gaping at Snape’s face, which
was continuing to swirl around the bowl. “I was using the Pensieve
when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather
hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly.
Naturally, it would have attracted your attention.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.
Dumbledore shook his head. “Curiosity is not a sin,” he said.
“But we should exercise caution with our curiosity . . . yes, indeed . . .”
Frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin
with the tip of his wand. Instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump,
scowling girl of about sixteen, who began to revolve slowly, with
her feet still in the basin. She took no notice whatsoever of Harry
or Professor Dumbledore. When she spoke, her voice echoed as
Snape’s had done, as though it were coming from the depths of the
stone basin. “He put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I

  
was only teasing him, sir. I only said I’d seen him kissing Florence
behind the greenhouses last Thursday. . . .”
“But why, Bertha,” said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the
now silently revolving girl, “why did you have to follow him in the
first place?”
“Bertha?” Harry whispered, looking up at her. “Is that — was
that Bertha Jorkins?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin
again; Bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and
opaque once more. “That was Bertha as I remember her at school.”
The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumbledore’s
face, and it struck Harry suddenly how very old he was looking.
He knew, of course, that Dumbledore was getting on in years,
but somehow he never really thought of Dumbledore as an old
man.
“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Before you got lost in
my thoughts, you wanted to tell me something.”
“Yes,” said Harry. “Professor — I was in Divination just now,
and — er — I fell asleep.”
He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but
Dumbledore merely said, “Quite understandable. Continue.”
“Well, I had a dream,” said Harry. “A dream about Lord Voldemort. He was torturing Wormtail . . . you know who Wormtail —”
“I do know,” said Dumbledore promptly. “Please continue.”
“Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like,
Wormtail’s blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead.
Then he said, Wormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was
a snake beside his chair. He said — he said he’d be feeding me to it,

  
instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail — and my
scar hurt,” Harry said. “It woke me up, it hurt so badly.”
Dumbledore merely looked at him.
“Er — that’s all,” said Harry.
“I see,” said Dumbledore quietly. “I see. Now, has your scar hurt
at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over
the summer?”
“No, I — how did you know it woke me up over the summer?”
said Harry, astonished.
“You are not Sirius’s only correspondent,” said Dumbledore. “I
have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last
year. It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest
place for him to stay.”
Dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his
desk. Every now and then, he placed his wand tip to his temple, removed another shining silver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that Harry couldn’t
make out anything clearly: It was merely a blur of color.
“Professor?” he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.
“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”
Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and
then said, “I have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief
that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you, and
when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred.”
“But . . . why?”
“Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,” said
Dumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”

  
“So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?”
“It is possible,” said Dumbledore. “I would say — probable.
Harry — did you see Voldemort?”
“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But — there
wouldn’t have been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn’t
got a body, has he? But . . . but then how could he have held the
wand?” Harry said slowly.
“How indeed?” muttered Dumbledore. “How indeed . . .”
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore
was gazing across the room, and, every now and then, placing his
wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to
the seething mass within the Pensieve.
“Professor,” Harry said at last, “do you think he’s getting
stronger?”
“Voldemort?” said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve. It was the characteristic, piercing look Dumbledore had
given him on other occasions, and always made Harry feel as
though Dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that
even Moody’s magical eye could not. “Once again, Harry, I can only
give you my suspicions.”
Dumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier,
than ever.
“The years of Voldemort’s ascent to power,” he said, “were
marked with disappearances. Bertha Jorkins has vanished without
a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last.
Mr. Crouch too has disappeared . . . within these very grounds.
And there was a third disappearance, one which the Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a
Muggle. His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where

  
Voldemort’s father grew up, and he has not been seen since last
August. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my
Ministry friends.”
Dumbledore looked very seriously at Harry.
“These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry
disagrees — as you may have heard, while waiting outside my
office.”
Harry nodded. Silence fell between them again, Dumbledore
extracting thoughts every now and then. Harry felt as though he
ought to go, but his curiosity held him in his chair.
“Professor?” he said again.
“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore.
“Er . . . could I ask you about . . . that court thing I was in . . .
in the Pensieve?”
“You could,” said Dumbledore heavily. “I attended it many
times, but some trials come back to me more clearly than others . . . particularly now. . . .”
“You know — you know the trial you found me in? The one
with Crouch’s son? Well . . . were they talking about Neville’s
parents?”
Dumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. “Has Neville never
told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother?” he
said.
Harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could
have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him.
“Yes, they were talking about Neville’s parents,” said Dumbledore. “His father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody.
He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort’s
whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard.”

  
“So they’re dead?” said Harry quietly.
“No,” said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had
never heard there before. “They are insane. They are both in St.
Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe
Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays.
They do not recognize him.”
Harry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known . . . never,
in four years, bothered to find out . . .
“The Longbottoms were very popular,” said Dumbledore.
“The attacks on them came after Voldemort’s fall from power, just
when everyone thought they were safe. Those attacks caused a
wave of fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was under
great pressure to catch those who had done it. Unfortunately, the
Longbottoms’ evidence was — given their condition — none too
reliable.”
“Then Mr. Crouch’s son might not have been involved?” said
Harry slowly.
Dumbledore shook his head.
“As to that, I have no idea.”
Harry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the
Pensieve swirl. There were two more questions he was burning to
ask . . . but they concerned the guilt of living people. . . .
“Er,” he said, “Mr. Bagman . . .”
“. . . has never been accused of any Dark activity since,” said
Dumbledore calmly.
“Right,” said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts. “And . . . er . . .”
But the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him.

  
Snape’s face was swimming on the surface again. Dumbledore
glanced down into it, and then up at Harry.
“No more has Professor Snape,” he said.
Harry looked into Dumbledore’s light blue eyes, and the thing
he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could
stop it.
“What made you think he’d really stopped supporting Voldemort, Professor?”
Dumbledore held Harry’s gaze for a few seconds, and then said,
“That, Harry, is a matter between Professor Snape and myself.”
Harry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore did not
look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was
time to go. He stood up, and so did Dumbledore.
“Harry,” he said as Harry reached the door. “Please do not speak
about Neville’s parents to anybody else. He has the right to let people know, when he is ready.”
“Yes, Professor,” said Harry, turning to go.
“And —”
Harry looked back. Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve,
his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older
than ever. He stared at Harry for a moment, and then said, “Good
luck with the third task.”

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - O N E
THE THIRD TAS K

Dumbledore reckons You-Know-Who’s getting stronger
again as well?” Ron whispered.
Everything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything
Dumbledore had told and shown him afterward, he had now
shared with Ron and Hermione — and, of course, with Sirius, to
whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left Dumbledore’s office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common
room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry’s mind
was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant
about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been
a relief to siphon them off.
Ron stared into the common room fire. Harry thought he saw
Ron shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm.
“And he trusts Snape?” Ron said. “He really trusts Snape, even
though he knows he was a Death Eater?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
D

  
Hermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was sitting with
her forehead in her hands, staring at her knees. Harry thought she
too looked as though she could have done with a Pensieve.
“Rita Skeeter,” she muttered finally.
“How can you be worrying about her now?” said Ron, in utter
disbelief.
“I’m not worrying about her,” Hermione said to her knees. “I’m
just thinking . . . remember what she said to me in the Three
Broomsticks? ‘I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make
your hair curl.’ This is what she meant, isn’t it? She reported his
trial, she knew he’d passed information to the Death Eaters. And
Winky too, remember . . . ‘Ludo Bagman’s a bad wizard.’ Mr.
Crouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked
about it at home.”
“Yeah, but Bagman didn’t pass information on purpose, did he?”
Hermione shrugged.
“And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?” Ron
said, turning back to Harry.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he’s only saying that because Crouch
disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.”
“We never thought of her, did we?” said Ron slowly. “Mind
you, she’s definitely got giant blood, and she doesn’t want to admit
it —”
“Of course she doesn’t,” said Hermione sharply, looking up.
“Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his
mother. Look at Fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just because she’s part giant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I’d probably say I had big bones if I knew that’s what I’d get for telling the
truth.”

  
Hermione looked at her watch. “We haven’t done any practicing!” she said, looking shocked. “We were going to do the Impediment Curse! We’ll have to really get down to it tomorrow! Come
on, Harry, you need to get some sleep.”
Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As
Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at Neville’s bed. True
to his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione
about Neville’s parents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed
into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents
still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy
from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Neville’s
snores, he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying
in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom. . . . He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch’s son and his companions
had been dragged from the court by the dementors. . . . He understood how they had felt. . . . Then he remembered the milk-white
face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died
a year later. . . .
It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his
bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. . . . He was the
one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these
lives. . . .
Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams,
which would finish on the day of the third task, but they were
putting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare.
“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said shortly when Harry
pointed this out to them and said he didn’t mind practicing on his

  
own for a while, “at least we’ll get top marks in Defense Against the
Dark Arts. We’d never have found out about all these hexes in
class.”
“Good training for when we’re all Aurors,” said Ron excitedly,
attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into
the room and making it stop dead in midair.
The mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and
tense again. Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which
would take place a week before the end of term. Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment. He felt more confident about
this task than either of the others. Difficult and dangerous though
it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to
find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead.
Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the
school, Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use
the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had
soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to
blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful
discovery of Hermione’s that would make his wand point due
north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the
right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with
the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary,
invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and
Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before
she had looked up the counter-jinx.

  
“You’re still doing really well, though,” Hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had
already learned. “Some of these are bound to come in handy.”
“Come and look at this,” said Ron, who was standing by the
window. He was staring down onto the grounds. “What’s Malfoy
doing?”
Harry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were
standing in the shadow of a tree below. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to
be keeping a lookout; both were smirking. Malfoy was holding his
hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.
“He looks like he’s using a walkie-talkie,” said Harry curiously.
“He can’t be,” said Hermione, “I’ve told you, those sorts of
things don’t work around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry,” she added
briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the
middle of the room, “let’s try that Shield Charm again.”
Sirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to
want to concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before
they concerned themselves with anything else. He reminded Harry
in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of
Hogwarts was not Harry’s responsibility, nor was it within his
power to influence it.
If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my
priority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands
on you while you are under Dumbledore’s protection, but all
the same, take no risks: Concentrate on getting through that
maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other
matters.

  
Harry’s nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer,
but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing, he was confident that, this time, he had
done everything in his power to prepare for the task. For another,
this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief.
Breakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the
morning of the third task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry
a good-luck card from Sirius. It was only a piece of parchment,
folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but Harry
appreciated it all the same. A screech owl arrived for Hermione,
carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual. She unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it.
“What?” said Harry and Ron together, staring at her.
“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper
out of sight, but Ron grabbed it. He stared at the headline and said,
“No way. Not today. That old cow.”
“What?” said Harry. “Rita Skeeter again?”
“No,” said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push
the paper out of sight.
“It’s about me, isn’t it?” said Harry.
“No,” said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone.
But before Harry could demand to see the paper, Draco Malfoy
shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.
“Hey, Potter! Potter! How’s your head? You feeling all right? Sure
you’re not going to go berserk on us?”
Malfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too. Slytherins

  
up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see
Harry’s reaction.
“Let me see it,” Harry said to Ron. “Give it here.”
Very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper. Harry turned
it over and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the
banner headline:
HARRY POTTER
“DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS”
The boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes
Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Alarming evidence has recently come to light about Harry Potter’s strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his
suitability to compete in a demanding competition
like the Triwizard Tournament, or even to attend
Hogwarts School.
Potter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal,
regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to
complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic
of the curse with which You-Know-Who attempted
to kill him). On Monday last, midway through a
Divination lesson, your Daily Prophet reporter
witnessed Potter storming from the class, claiming
that his scar was hurting too badly to continue
studying.
It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potter’s brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon

  
him by You-Know-Who, and that his insistence
that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his
deep-seated confusion.
“He might even be pretending,” said one specialist. “This could be a plea for attention.”
The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed
worrying facts about Harry Potter that Albus
Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the wizarding public.
“Potter can speak Parseltongue,” reveals Draco
Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year. “There were a lot
of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and
most people thought Potter was behind them after
they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and
set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up,
though. But he’s made friends with werewolves and
giants too. We think he’d do anything for a bit of
power.”
Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes,
has long been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the
most famous Parselmouth of our times is none
other than You-Know-Who himself. A member of
the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to
remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any
wizard who could speak Parseltongue “as worthy of
investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes,
as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of
Dark Magic, and are historically associated with

  
evildoers.” Similarly, “anyone who seeks out the
company of such vicious creatures as werewolves
and giants would appear to have a fondness for
violence.”
Albus Dumbledore should surely consider
whether a boy such as this should be allowed to
compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Some fear
that Potter might resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of
which takes place this evening.
“Gone off me a bit, hasn’t she?” said Harry lightly, folding up the
paper.
Over at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were
laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling
grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes.
“How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?” Ron said.
“There’s no way she was there, there’s no way she could’ve heard —”
“The window was open,” said Harry. “I opened it to breathe.”
“You were at the top of North Tower!” Hermione said. “Your
voice couldn’t have carried all the way down to the grounds!”
“Well, you’re the one who’s supposed to be researching magical
methods of bugging!” said Harry. “You tell me how she did it!”
“I’ve been trying!” said Hermione. “But I . . . but . . .”
An odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione’s face.
She slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.
“Are you all right?” said Ron, frowning at her.
“Yes,” said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers through
her hair again, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though

  
speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie. Harry and Ron stared at
each other.
“I’ve had an idea,” Hermione said, gazing into space. “I think I
know . . . because then no one would be able to see . . . even
Moody . . . and she’d have been able to get onto the window
ledge . . . but she’s not allowed . . . she’s definitely not allowed . . . I
think we’ve got her! Just give me two seconds in the library — just
to make sure!”
With that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of
the Great Hall.
“Oi!” Ron called after her. “We’ve got our History of Magic
exam in ten minutes! Blimey,” he said, turning back to Harry, “she
must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an
exam. What’re you going to do in Binns’s class — read again?”
Exempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard champion,
Harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking
up fresh hexes for the third task.
“S’pose so,” Harry said to Ron; but just then, Professor McGonagall came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward him.
“Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the
Hall after breakfast,” she said.
“But the task’s not till tonight!” said Harry, accidentally spilling
scrambled eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.
“I’m aware of that, Potter,” she said. “The champions’ families
are invited to watch the final task, you know. This is simply a
chance for you to greet them.”
She moved away. Harry gaped after her.
“She doesn’t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?” he asked
Ron blankly.

  
“Dunno,” said Ron. “Harry, I’d better hurry, I’m going to be late
for Binns. See you later.”
Harry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall. He saw
Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as
he crossed to the side chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to
join them shortly afterward. Harry stayed where he was. He really
didn’t want to go into the chamber. He had no family — no family
who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway. But just as he
was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to the library
and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber
opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.
“Harry, come on, they’re waiting for you!”
Utterly perplexed, Harry got up. The Dursleys couldn’t possibly
be here, could they? He walked across the Hall and opened the
door into the chamber.
Cedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum
was over in a corner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and
father in rapid Bulgarian. He had inherited his father’s hooked nose.
On the other side of the room, Fleur was jabbering away in
French to her mother. Fleur’s little sister, Gabrielle, was holding her
mother’s hand. She waved at Harry, who waved back, grinning.
Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.
“Surprise!” Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and
walked over to them. “Thought we’d come and watch you, Harry!”
She bent down and kissed him on the cheek.
“You all right?” said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his
hand. “Charlie wanted to come, but he couldn’t get time off. He
said you were incredible against the Horntail.”

  
Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother’s shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them.
“This is really nice of you,” Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley. “I
thought for a moment — the Dursleys —”
“Hmm,” said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes
flashed every time they were mentioned.
“It’s great being back here,” said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady’s friend, winked at him from her frame).
“Haven’t seen this place for five years. Is that picture of the mad
knight still around? Sir Cadogan?”
“Oh yeah,” said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous
year.
“And the Fat Lady?” said Bill.
“She was here in my time,” said Mrs. Weasley. “She gave me
such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at
four in the morning —”
“What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the
morning?” said Bill, surveying his mother with amazement.
Mrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.
“Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll,” she said. “He
got caught by Apollyon Pringle — he was the caretaker in those
days — your father’s still got the marks.”
“Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?” said Bill.
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry, and they made their way back toward
the door into the Great Hall. As they passed Amos Diggory, he
looked around.
“There you are, are you?” he said, looking Harry up and down.

  
“Bet you’re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric’s caught
you up on points, are you?”
“What?” said Harry.
“Ignore him,” said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father. “He’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter’s article
about the Triwizard Tournament — you know, when she made out
you were the only Hogwarts champion.”
“Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he?” said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of
the door with Mrs. Weasley and Bill. “Still . . . you’ll show him,
Ced. Beaten him once before, haven’t you?”
“Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!” Mrs.
Weasley said angrily. “I would have thought you’d know that,
working at the Ministry!”
Mr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something
angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged
and turned away.
Harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny
grounds with Bill and Mrs. Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship. Mrs. Weasley was
intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been planted after
she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper
before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.
“How’s Percy?” Harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses.
“Not good,” said Bill.
“He’s very upset,” said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and
glancing around. “The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch’s disappearance quiet, but Percy’s been hauled in for questioning about

  
the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in. They seem to
think there’s a chance they weren’t genuinely written by him.
Percy’s been under a lot of strain. They’re not letting him fill in for
Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to
be doing it.”
They returned to the castle for lunch.
“Mum — Bill!” said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the
Gryffindor table. “What’re you doing here?”
“Come to watch Harry in the last task!” said Mrs. Weasley
brightly. “I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook.
How was your exam?”
“Oh . . . okay,” said Ron. “Couldn’t remember all the goblin
rebels’ names, so I invented a few. It’s all right,” he said, helping
himself to a Cornish pasty, while Mrs. Weasley looked stern,
“they’re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn’t hard.”
Fred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too, and
Harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he
were back at the Burrow; he had forgotten to worry about that
evening’s task, and not until Hermione turned up, halfway through
lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about Rita
Skeeter.
“Are you going to tell us — ?”
Hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs.
Weasley.
“Hello, Hermione,” said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than
usual.
“Hello,” said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs. Weasley’s face.

  
Harry looked between them, then said, “Mrs. Weasley, you didn’t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you?
Because Hermione’s not my girlfriend.”
“Oh!” said Mrs. Weasley. “No — of course I didn’t!”
But she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after
that.
Harry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a
long walk around the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall
for the evening feast. Ludo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had
joined the staff table now. Bagman looked quite cheerful, but Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame Maxime, looked
stern and was not talking. Madame Maxime was concentrating on
her plate, and Harry thought her eyes looked red. Hagrid kept
glancing along the table at her.
There were more courses than usual, but Harry, who was starting to feel really nervous now, didn’t eat much. As the enchanted
ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and silence fell.
“Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes’ time, I will be asking
you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third
and final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions
please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now.”
Harry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck,
and he headed off out of the Great Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and
Viktor.
“Feeling all right, Harry?” Bagman asked as they went down the
stone steps onto the grounds. “Confident?”
“I’m okay,” said Harry. It was sort of true; he was nervous, but

  
he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing
in his mind as they walked, and the knowledge that he could
remember them all made him feel better.
They walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable. A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way
around the edge of it. There was a gap right in front of them: the
entrance to the vast maze. The passage beyond it looked dark and
creepy.
Five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of
excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students
filed into their seats. The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the
first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They were
wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid,
who had his on the back of his moleskin vest.
“We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,” said
Professor McGonagall to the champions. “If you get into difficulty,
and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us
will come and get you, do you understand?”
The champions nodded.
“Off you go, then!” said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.
“Good luck, Harry,” Hagrid whispered, and the four of them
walked away in different directions, to station themselves around
the maze. Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered,
“Sonorus,” and his magically magnified voice echoed into the
stands.
“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard

  
Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points
currently stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each —
Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts
School!” The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden
Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. “In second place, with
eighty points — Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!”
More applause. “And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of
Beauxbatons Academy!”
Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up
at them, and they waved back, beaming at him.
“So . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman.
“Three — two — one —”
He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze.
The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and,
whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had
been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced
the moment they entered the maze. Harry felt almost as though he
were underwater again. He pulled out his wand, muttered,
“Lumos,” and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.
After about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each
other.
“See you,” Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric
took the right.
Harry heard Bagman’s whistle for the second time. Krum had
entered the maze. Harry sped up. His chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned right, and hurried on, holding his

  
wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead as possible. Still,
there was nothing in sight.
Bagman’s whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of
the champions were now inside.
Harry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him. The maze was growing darker with
every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy. He
reached a second fork.
“Point Me,” he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.
The wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into
solid hedge. That way was north, and he knew that he needed to go
northwest for the center of the maze. The best he could do was to
take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible.
The path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right
turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked. Harry didn’t
know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he
should have met something by now? It felt as though the maze were
luring him into a false sense of security. Then he heard movement
right behind him. He held out his wand, ready to attack, but its
beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on
the right-hand side. Cedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of
his robe was smoking.
“Hagrid’s Blast-Ended Skrewts!” he hissed. “They’re enormous — I only just got away!”
He shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path.
Keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts,
Harry hurried off again. Then, as he turned a corner, he saw . . . a
dementor gliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its

  
hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing
its way blindly toward him. Harry could hear its rattling breath; he
felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to
do. . . .
He summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated
with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and
celebrating with Ron and Hermione, raised his wand, and cried,
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silver stag erupted from the end of Harry’s wand and galloped
toward the dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of
its robes. . . . Harry had never seen a dementor stumble.
“Hang on!” he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver
Patronus. “You’re a boggart! Riddikulus!”
There was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter exploded in a wisp
of smoke. The silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could
have stayed, he could have used some company . . . but he moved
on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, his wand held
high once more.
Left . . . right . . . left again . . . Twice he found himself facing
dead ends. He did the Four-Point Spell again and found that he
was going too far east. He turned back, took a right turn, and saw
an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.
Harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand’s beam at it.
This looked like some kind of enchantment. He wondered
whether he might be able to blast it out of the way.
“Reducto!” he said.
The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He
supposed he should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for

  
solid objects. What would happen if he walked through the mist?
Was it worth chancing it, or should he double back?
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
“Fleur?” Harry yelled.
There was silence. He stared all around him. What had happened to her? Her scream seemed to have come from somewhere
ahead. He took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist.
The world turned upside down. Harry was hanging from the
ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose,
threatening to fall into the bottomless sky. He clutched them to the
end of his nose and hung there, terrified. It felt as though his feet
were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling. Below
him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly. He felt as
though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from
the earth completely.
Think, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head,
think . . .
But not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to
combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky. Did he dare move his
foot? He could hear the blood pounding in his ears. He had two
choices — try and move, or send up red sparks, and get rescued
and disqualified from the task.
He shut his eyes, so he wouldn’t be able to see the view of endless space below him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could
away from the grassy ceiling.
Immediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell forward onto his
knees onto the wonderfully solid ground. He felt temporarily limp
with shock. He took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again

  
and hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he ran away
from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the
moonlight.
He paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for
some sign of Fleur. He was sure it had been she who had screamed.
What had she met? Was she all right? There was no sign of red
sparks — did that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was
she in such trouble that she couldn’t reach her wand? Harry took
the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . . but at the
same time, he couldn’t help thinking, One champion down . . .
The cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though
Fleur was no longer in the running. He’d got this far, hadn’t he?
What if he actually managed to win? Fleetingly, and for the first
time since he’d found himself champion, he saw again that image
of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the
school. . . .
He met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead
ends. Twice he took the same wrong turning. Finally, he found a
new route and started to jog along it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls. Then he
rounded another corner and found himself facing a Blast-Ended
Skrewt.
Cedric was right — it was enormous. Ten feet long, it looked
more like a giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled
over its back. Its thick armor glinted in the light from Harry’s
wand, which he pointed at it.
“Stupefy!”
The spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded; Harry ducked

  
just in time, but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of
his head. The skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.
“Impedimenta!” Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor
again and ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell
over. “IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry
pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt
would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another;
forcing himself to stop, heart hammering, he performed the FourPoint Spell again, backtracked, and chose a path that would take
him northwest.
He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes,
when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own
that made him stop dead.
“What are you doing?” yelled Cedric’s voice. “What the hell
d’you think you’re doing?”
And then Harry heard Krum’s voice.
“Crucio!”
The air was suddenly full of Cedric’s yells. Horrified, Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way into Cedric’s. When
none appeared, he tried the Reductor Curse again. It wasn’t very effective, but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which
Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches
until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it,

  
tearing his robes, and looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and
twitching on the ground, Krum standing over him.
Harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as
Krum looked up. Krum turned and began to run.
“Stupefy!” Harry yelled.
The spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks,
fell forward, and lay motionless, facedown in the grass. Harry
dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying
there panting, his hands over his face.
“Are you all right?” Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric’s arm.
“Yeah,” panted Cedric. “Yeah . . . I don’t believe it . . . he crept
up behind me. . . . I heard him, I turned around, and he had his
wand on me. . . .”
Cedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry looked down
at Krum.
“I can’t believe this . . . I thought he was all right,” Harry said,
staring at Krum.
“So did I,” said Cedric.
“Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?” said Harry.
“Yeah,” said Cedric. “You don’t think Krum got her too?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly.
“Should we leave him here?” Cedric muttered.
“No,” said Harry. “I reckon we should send up red sparks.
Someone’ll come and collect him . . . otherwise he’ll probably be
eaten by a skrewt.”
“He’d deserve it,” Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised
his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking the spot where he lay.

  
Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment,
looking around them. Then Cedric said, “Well . . . I s’pose we’d
better go on . . . .”
“What?” said Harry. “Oh . . . yeah . . . right . . .”
It was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been briefly united
against Krum — now the fact that they were opponents came back
to Harry. The two of them proceeded up the dark path without
speaking, then Harry turned left, and Cedric right. Cedric’s footsteps soon died away.
Harry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction. It was between him
and Cedric now. His desire to reach the cup first was now burning
stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what he’d just seen
Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable Curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had told
them. Krum surely couldn’t have wanted the Triwizard Cup that
badly. . . . Harry sped up.
Every so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze.
Then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement
once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his Monster
Book of Monsters.
It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion: great clawed
paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes
upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She
was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the
path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.

  
“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.”
“So . . . so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing what the
answer was going to be.
“No,” she said, continuing to pace. “Not unless you can answer
my riddle. Answer on your first guess — I let you pass. Answer
wrongly — I attack. Remain silent — I will let you walk away from
me unscathed.”
Harry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who
was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If
the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the
sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.
“Okay,” he said. “Can I hear the riddle?”
The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of
the path, and recited:
“First think of the person who lives in disguise,
Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.
Next, tell me what’s always the last thing to mend,
The middle of middle and end of the end?
And finally give me the sound often heard
During the search for a hard-to-find word.
Now string them together, and answer me this,
Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss?”
Harry gaped at her.
“Could I have it again . . . more slowly?” he asked tentatively.
She blinked at him, smiled, and repeated the poem.
“All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn’t want to kiss?”
Harry asked.

  
She merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took that for a
“yes.” Harry cast his mind around. There were plenty of animals he
wouldn’t want to kiss; his immediate thought was a Blast-Ended
Skrewt, but something told him that wasn’t the answer. He’d have
to try and work out the clues. . . .
“A person in disguise,” Harry muttered, staring at her, “who
lies . . . er . . . that’d be a — an imposter. No, that’s not my guess!
A — a spy? I’ll come back to that . . . could you give me the next
clue again, please?”
She repeated the next lines of the poem.
“ ‘The last thing to mend,’ ” Harry repeated. “Er . . . no idea . . .
‘middle of middle’ . . . could I have the last bit again?”
She gave him the last four lines.
“ ‘The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find
word,’ ” said Harry. “Er . . . that’d be . . . er . . . hang on — ‘er’! Er’s
a sound!”
The sphinx smiled at him.
“Spy . . . er . . . spy . . . er . . .” said Harry, pacing up and down.
“A creature I wouldn’t want to kiss . . . a spider!”
The sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up, stretched her front
legs, and then moved aside for him to pass.
“Thanks!” said Harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he
dashed forward.
He had to be close now, he had to be. . . . His wand was telling
him he was bang on course; as long as he didn’t meet anything too
horrible, he might have a chance. . . .
Harry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up ahead.
“Point Me!” he whispered again to his wand, and it spun around

  
and pointed him to the right-hand one. He dashed up this one and
saw light ahead.
The Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards
away. Suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of
him.
Cedric was going to get there first. Cedric was sprinting as fast as
he could toward the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up,
Cedric was much taller, had much longer legs —
Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left,
moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own; it was
moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes
on the cup, had not seen it —
“Cedric!” Harry bellowed. “On your left!”
Cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing
and avoid colliding with it, but in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw
Cedric’s wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into
the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.
“Stupefy!” Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider’s gigantic, hairy
black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have
thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at
Harry instead.
“Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!”
But it was no use — the spider was either so large, or so magical,
that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it. Harry had
one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and razor-sharp
pincers before it was upon him.
He was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly,
he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the pincers and next

  
moment he was in excruciating pain. He could hear Cedric yelling
“Stupefy!” too, but his spell had no more effect than Harry’s —
Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more
and shouted “Expelliarmus!”
It worked — the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him,
but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured
leg, which crumpled beneath him. Without pausing to think, he
aimed high at the spider’s underbelly, as he had done with the
skrewt, and shouted “Stupefy!” just as Cedric yelled the same thing.
The two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing
the path with a tangle of hairy legs.
“Harry!” he heard Cedric shouting. “You all right? Did it fall on
you?”
“No,” Harry called back, panting. He looked down at his leg.
It was bleeding freely. He could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the spider’s pincers on his torn robes. He tried to get up,
but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his
weight. He leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and
looked around.
Cedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was
gleaming behind him.
“Take it, then,” Harry panted to Cedric. “Go on, take it. You’re
there.”
But Cedric didn’t move. He merely stood there, looking at
Harry. Then he turned to stare at the cup. Harry saw the longing
expression on his face in its golden light. Cedric looked around at
Harry again, who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself. Cedric took a deep breath.

  
“You take it. You should win. That’s twice you’ve saved my neck
in here.”
“That’s not how it’s supposed to work,” Harry said. He felt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all over from trying to
throw off the spider, and after all his efforts, Cedric had beaten him
to it, just as he’d beaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball. “The one
who reaches the cup first gets the points. That’s you. I’m telling
you, I’m not going to win any races on this leg.”
Cedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from
the cup, shaking his head.
“No,” he said.
“Stop being noble,” said Harry irritably. “Just take it, then we
can get out of here.”
Cedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight to the
hedge.
“You told me about the dragons,” Cedric said. “I would’ve gone
down in the first task if you hadn’t told me what was coming.”
“I had help on that too,” Harry snapped, trying to mop up his
bloody leg with his robes. “You helped me with the egg — we’re
square.”
“I had help on the egg in the first place,” said Cedric.
“We’re still square,” said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook
violently as he put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the
spider had dropped him.
“You should’ve got more points on the second task,” said Cedric
mulishly. “You stayed behind to get all the hostages. I should’ve
done that.”
“I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!” said Harry bitterly. “Just take the cup!”

  
“No,” said Cedric.
He stepped over the spider’s tangled legs to join Harry, who
stared at him. Cedric was serious. He was walking away from the
sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn’t had in centuries.
“Go on,” Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him
every ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were
folded, he seemed decided.
Harry looked from Cedric to the cup. For one shining moment,
he saw himself emerging from the maze, holding it. He saw himself
holding the Triwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw
Cho’s face shining with admiration, more clearly than he had ever
seen it before . . . and then the picture faded, and he found himself
staring at Cedric’s shadowy, stubborn face.
“Both of us,” Harry said.
“What?”
“We’ll take it at the same time. It’s still a Hogwarts victory. We’ll
tie for it.”
Cedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.
“You — you sure?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . we’ve helped each other out,
haven’t we? We both got here. Let’s just take it together.”
For a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn’t believe his
ears; then his face split in a grin.
“You’re on,” he said. “Come here.”
He grabbed Harry’s arm below the shoulder and helped Harry
limp toward the plinth where the cup stood. When they had
reached it, they both held a hand out over one of the cup’s gleaming handles.

  
“On three, right?” said Harry. “One — two — three —”
He and Cedric both grasped a handle.
Instantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet
had left the ground. He could not unclench the hand holding the
Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and
swirling color, Cedric at his side.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - T W O
FLESH, BLOOD, AND BON E

Harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave
way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard
Cup at last. He raised his head.
“Where are we?” he said.
Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and
they looked around.
They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles — perhaps hundreds of miles — for even the
mountains surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing
instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a
small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A
hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the
outline of a fine old house on the hillside.
Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.
“Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?” he asked.
H

  
“Nope,” said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It
was completely silent and slightly eerie. “Is this supposed to be part
of the task?”
“I dunno,” said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. “Wands
out, d’you reckon?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion
rather than him.
They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him.
He had, yet again, the strange feeling that they were being
watched.
“Someone’s coming,” he said suddenly.
Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure
drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves.
Harry couldn’t make out a face, but from the way it was walking
and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something.
Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled
up over his head to obscure his face. And — several paces nearer,
the gap between them closing all the time — Harry saw that the
thing in the person’s arms looked like a baby . . . or was it merely a
bundle of robes?
Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric.
Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch
the approaching figure.
It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet
from them. For a second, Harry and Cedric and the short figure
simply looked at one another.
And then, without warning, Harry’s scar exploded with pain. It
was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped

  
from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head
was about to split open.
From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say,
“Kill the spare.”
A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words
to the night: “Avada Kedavra!”
A blast of green light blazed through Harry’s eyelids, and he
heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in
his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging
eyes.
Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He
was dead.
For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into
Cedric’s face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the
windows of a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which
looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry’s mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb
disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.
The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his
wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone.
Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he
was forced around and slammed against it.
qlj=ofaaib=
The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry,
tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear

  
shallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled,
and the man hit him — hit him with a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was Wormtail.
“You!” he gasped.
But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers
trembling uncontrollably, fumbling over the knots. Once sure that
Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn’t move
an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the
inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry’s mouth; then,
without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry
couldn’t make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone;
he couldn’t turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see
only what was right in front of him.
Cedric’s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry’s
wand was on the ground at Cedric’s feet. The bundle of robes that
Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave.
It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar
seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly knew that he didn’t
want to see what was in those robes . . . he didn’t want that bundle
opened. . . .
He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a
gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone
where he was tied. Wormtail’s fast, wheezy breathing was growing
louder again. It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy
across the ground. Then he came back within Harry’s range of
vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot
of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water — Harry could

  
hear it slopping around — and it was larger than any cauldron
Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a fullgrown man to sit in.
The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring
more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a
wand. Suddenly there were crackling flames beneath it. The large
snake slithered away into the darkness.
The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface
began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it
were on fire. Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements beneath the robes became
more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.
“Hurry!”
The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It
might have been encrusted with diamonds.
“It is ready, Master.”
“Now . . .” said the cold voice.
Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what
was inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the
wad of material blocking his mouth.
It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed
something ugly, slimy, and blind — but worse, a hundred times
worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a
crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything
less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face —
no child alive ever had a face like that — flat and snakelike, with
gleaming red eyes.

  
The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put
them around Wormtail’s neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so,
his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail’s weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the
rim of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face
illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And
then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a
hiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body
hit the bottom with a soft thud.
Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please . . . let it drown. . . .
Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened
beyond his wits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to
the night.
“Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!”
The surface of the grave at Harry’s feet cracked. Horrified, Harry
watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail’s command and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the
water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions and turned a
vivid, poisonous-looking blue.
And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin,
shining silver dagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into
petrified sobs.
“Flesh — of the servant — w-willingly given — you will —
revive — your master.”
He stretched his right hand out in front of him — the hand
with the missing finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his
left hand and swung it upward.
Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it

  
happened — he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could
not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through
Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He
heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail’s anguished
panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into
the cauldron. Harry couldn’t stand to look . . . but the potion had
turned a burning red; the light of it shone through Harry’s closed
eyelids. . . .
Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until
Harry felt Wormtail’s anguished breath on his face did he realize
that Wormtail was right in front of him.
“B-blood of the enemy . . . forcibly taken . . . you will . . . resurrect
your foe.”
Harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. . . .
Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he
saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail’s remaining
hand. He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and
blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still
panting with pain, fumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it
to Harry’s cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.
He staggered back to the cauldron with Harry’s blood. He
poured it inside. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding
white. Wormtail, his job done, dropped to his knees beside the
cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling
the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.
The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all
directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety
blackness. Nothing happened. . . .
Let it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone wrong. . . .

  
And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron
were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the
cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that
he couldn’t see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air. . . . It’s gone wrong, he thought . . . it’s drowned . . .
please . . . please let it be dead. . . .
But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy
surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin,
rising slowly from inside the cauldron.
“Robe me,” said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and
Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm,
scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his
feet, reached up, and pulled them one-handed over his master’s
head.
The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry . . .
and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet
eyes and a nose that was flat as a snake’s with slits for nostrils . . .
Lord Voldemort had risen again.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - T H R E E
THE DEATH EATER S

Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining
his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long
white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes,
whose pupils were slits, like a cat’s, gleamed still more brightly
through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers,
his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of
Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of
the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a
wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed
it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against
the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay
there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes
upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.
V
THE DEATH EATERS
  
Wormtail’s robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped
the stump of his arm in them.
“My Lord . . .” he choked, “my Lord . . . you promised . . . you
did promise . . .”
“Hold out your arm,” said Voldemort lazily.
“Oh Master . . . thank you, Master . . .”
He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again.
“The other arm, Wormtail.”
“Master, please . . . please . . .”
Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail’s left arm; he
forced the sleeve of Wormtail’s robes up past his elbow, and Harry
saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth — the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the
Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail’s
uncontrollable weeping.
“It is back,” he said softly, “they will all have noticed it . . . and
now, we shall see . . . now we shall know . . .”
He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail’s
arm.
The scar on Harry’s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and
Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from
Wormtail’s mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.
A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened
up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard.
“How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?”
he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. “And how
many will be foolish enough to stay away?”

  
He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes
sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he
looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike
face.
“You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,”
he hissed softly. “A Muggle and a fool . . . very like your dear
mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother
died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see
how useful he has proved himself, in death. . . .”
Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all
around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the
grass.
“You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived
there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love
with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she
was. . . . He didn’t like magic, my father . . .
“He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was
even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be
raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him . . . I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom
Riddle. . . .”
Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.
“Listen to me, reliving family history . . .” he said quietly, “why,
I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .”
The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between
graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were
Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one
they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could

  
hardly believe their eyes. Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for
them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the hem of his black robes.
“Master . . . Master . . .” he murmured.
The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before
backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle’s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and
twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle,
as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not
seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and
though there was no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered.
“Welcome, Death Eaters,” said Voldemort quietly. “Thirteen
years . . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as
though it were yesterday. . . . We are still united under the Dark
Mark, then! Or are we?”
He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils
widening.
“I smell guilt,” he said. “There is a stench of guilt upon the air.”
A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of
it longed, but did not dare, to step back from him.
“I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact —
such prompt appearances! — and I ask myself . . . why did this
band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom
they swore eternal loyalty?”
No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon
the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm.
“And I answer myself,” whispered Voldemort, “they must have

  
believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back
among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance,
and bewitchment. . . .
“And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I
would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to
guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of
the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than
any wizard living?
“And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power
could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort . . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion
of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?”
At the mention of Dumbledore’s name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort
ignored them.
“It is a disappointment to me . . . I confess myself disappointed. . . .”
One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the
circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort’s
feet.
“Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!”
Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.
“Crucio!”
The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry
was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the
police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . . . anything . . .
Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat
upon the ground, gasping.
“Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly. “Stand up. You ask for

  
forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long
years . . . I want thirteen years’ repayment before I forgive you.
Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not,
Wormtail?”
He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.
“You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your
old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don’t
you?”
“Yes, Master,” moaned Wormtail, “please, Master . . . please . . .”
“Yet you helped return me to my body,” said Voldemort coolly,
watching Wormtail sob on the ground. “Worthless and traitorous
as you are, you helped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his
helpers. . . .”
Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air.
A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the
wand’s wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed
itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail’s
bleeding wrist.
Wormtail’s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and
ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver
hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were
wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then,
trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it
into powder.
“My Lord,” he whispered. “Master . . . it is beautiful . . . thank
you . . . thank you. . . .”
He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort’s robes.

  
“May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,” said
Voldemort.
“No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .”
Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his
powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort
now approached the man on Wormtail’s right.
“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him.
“I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the
world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the
lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to
find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup
were fun, I daresay . . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?”
“My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius Malfoy’s
voice swiftly from beneath the hood. “Had there been any sign
from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at
your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me —”
“And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater
sent it into the sky last summer?” said Voldemort lazily, and Mr.
Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. “Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. . . . I expect more faithful service in the future.”
“Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank
you. . . .”
Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space — large
enough for two people — that separated Malfoy and the next man.
“The Lestranges should stand here,” said Voldemort quietly.
“But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They
went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is

  
broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams.
The dementors will join us . . . they are our natural allies . . . we
will recall the banished giants . . . I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. . . .”
He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence,
but he paused before others and spoke to them.
“Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of
Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than
that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. . . .”
“Thank you, Master . . . thank you,” murmured Macnair.
“And here” — Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded
figures — “we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will
you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?”
They bowed clumsily, muttering dully.
“Yes, Master . . .”
“We will, Master. . . .”
“The same goes for you, Nott,” said Voldemort quietly as he
walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle’s shadow.
“My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most
faithful —”
“That will do,” said Voldemort.
He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it
with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing
there.
“And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in
my service. One, too cowardly to return . . . he will pay. One, who
I believe has left me forever . . . he will be killed, of course . . . and
one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already
reentered my service.”

  
The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways
at one another through their masks.
“He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his
efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . .
“Yes,” said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the
eyes of the circle flashed in Harry’s direction. “Harry Potter has
kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to
call him my guest of honor.”
There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s voice spoke from under
the mask.
“Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . . how you
have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return
to us. . . .”
“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort. “And it
begins — and ends — with my young friend here.”
He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of
the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued
to circle.
“You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?” Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar
began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. “You all
know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill
him. His mother died in the attempt to save him — and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. . . . I could not touch the boy.”
Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very
close to Harry’s cheek.
“His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. . . . This is

  
old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook
it . . . but no matter. I can touch him now.”
Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and
thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed
softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters.
“I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected
by the woman’s foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself.
Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit,
less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive. What I was,
even I do not know . . . I, who have gone further than anybody
along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal — to
conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or
more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not been killed,
though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help
myself . . . for I had no body, and every spell that might have
helped me required the use of a wand. . . .
“I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second
by second, to exist. . . . I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and
I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and
find me . . . one of them would come and perform the magic I
could not, to restore me to a body . . . but I waited in vain. . . .”
The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death
Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing.
“Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies
of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful,
for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me.

  
I sometimes inhabited animals — snakes, of course, being my preference — but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit,
for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . .
“Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed
assured. A wizard — young, foolish, and gullible — wandered
across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed
the very chance I had been dreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at
Dumbledore’s school . . . he was easy to bend to my will . . . he
brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer’s
Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . .
thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. . . .”
Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on
the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.
“The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as
ever I had been,” Voldemort continued. “I returned to my hiding
place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn’t then fear
that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my
darkest hour . . . I could not hope that I would be sent another
wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my
Death Eaters cared what had become of me. . . .”
One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice.
“And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned
hope, it happened at last . . . a servant returned to me. Wormtail
here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out

  
of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long
been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he
met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do
you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a
place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small
animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that
possessed them. . . .
“But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail?
For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had
hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . .
and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch
from the Ministry of Magic.
“Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might
have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail — displaying a presence of mind I would never
have expected from him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her . . . he brought
her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved
instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams . . . for — with a little persuasion — she became a veritable mine of information.
“She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at
Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death
Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only
contact him. She told me many things . . . but the means I used to
break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I
had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body
were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.”

  
Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and
pitiless.
“Wormtail’s body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all
assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if
noticed. However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and,
poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak
body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting
the essential ingredients for true rebirth . . . a spell or two of my
own invention . . . a little help from my dear Nagini,” Voldemort’s
red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, “a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returned to an almost human form, and
strong enough to travel.
“There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer’s Stone anymore, for
I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower . . . I would settle for my old
body back again, and my old strength.
“I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of Dark Magic,
the potion that revived me tonight — I would need three powerful
ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not,
Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . .
“My father’s bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come
here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe . . . Wormtail
would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any
wizard who had hated me . . . as so many of them still do. But I
knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than
I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potter’s blood.

  
I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once
gave him would then reside in my veins too. . . .
“But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by
Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy’s future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy’s
protection as long as he is in his relations’ care. Not even I can
touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch
World Cup. . . . I thought his protection might be weaker there,
away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong
enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from morning
until night. So how could I take him?
“Why . . . by using Bertha Jorkins’s information, of course. Use
my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that
the boy’s name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death
Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament — that he
touched the Triwizard Cup first — the cup which my Death Eater
had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond
the reach of Dumbledore’s help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is . . . the boy you all believed had been my
downfall. . . .”
Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He
raised his wand.
“Crucio!”
It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his
very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar;

  
his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end . . . to
black out . . . to die . . .
And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort’s father, looking up into
those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing
with the sound of the Death Eaters’ laughter.
“You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy
could ever have been stronger than me,” said Voldemort. “But I
want there to be no mistake in anybody’s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my
power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there
is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will
give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be
left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer,
Nagini,” he whispered, and the snake glided away through the
grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching.
“Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.”

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - F O U R
PRIORI INCANTATE M

Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his
feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of
material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the
bonds tying Harry to the gravestone.
There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he
stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks,
forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the
gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled.
Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric’s body
lay and returned with Harry’s wand, which he thrust roughly into
Harry’s hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his
place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.
“You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?” said Voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness.
W

  
At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life,
the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years
ago. . . . All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, “Expelliarmus” . . . and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his
wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters,
outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing
the thing against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse — and Voldemort was right — his
mother was not here to die for him this time. . . . He was quite
unprotected. . . .
“We bow to each other, Harry,” said Voldemort, bending a little,
but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry. “Come, the
niceties must be observed. . . . Dumbledore would like you to show
manners. . . . Bow to death, Harry. . . .”
The Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemort’s lipless
mouth was smiling. Harry did not bow. He was not going to let
Voldemort play with him before killing him . . . he was not going
to give him that satisfaction. . . .
“I said, bow,” Voldemort said, raising his wand — and Harry felt
his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him
ruthlessly forward, and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.
“Very good,” said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand
the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too. “And now you
face me, like a man . . . straight-backed and proud, the way your
father died. . . .
“And now — we duel.”
Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything
to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again

  
by the Cruciatus Curse. The pain was so intense, so all-consuming,
that he no longer knew where he was. . . . White-hot knives were
piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst
with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he’d ever screamed in
his life —
And then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet;
he was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his
hand had been cut off; he staggered sideways into the wall of
watching Death Eaters, and they pushed him away, back toward
Voldemort.
“A little break,” said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating
with excitement, “a little pause . . . That hurt, didn’t it, Harry? You
don’t want me to do that again, do you?”
Harry didn’t answer. He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes were telling him so . . . he was going to die, and there
was nothing he could do about it. . . but he wasn’t going to play
along. He wasn’t going to obey Voldemort . . . he wasn’t going to
beg. . . .
“I asked you whether you want me to do that again,” said Voldemort softly. “Answer me! Imperio!”
And Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that
his mind had been wiped of all thought. . . . Ah, it was bliss, not to
think, it was as though he were floating, dreaming . . . just answer
no . . . say no . . . just answer no. . . .
I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won’t
answer. . . .
Just answer no. . . .
I won’t do it, I won’t say it. . . .
Just answer no. . . .

  
“I WON’T!”
And these words burst from Harry’s mouth; they echoed
through the graveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as
though cold water had been thrown over him — back rushed the
aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body — back
rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing. . . .
“You won’t?” said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were
not laughing now. “You won’t say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue
I need to teach you before you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose
of pain?”
Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with
the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of
Voldemort’s father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him.
“We are not playing hide-and-seek, Harry,” said Voldemort’s soft,
cold voice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. “You cannot hide from me. Does this mean you are tired of our duel? Does
this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now, Harry? Come
out, Harry . . . come out and play, then . . . it will be quick . . . it
might even be painless . . . I would not know . . . I have never
died. . . .”
Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had
come. There was no hope . . . no help to be had. And as he heard
Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a
child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at
Voldemort’s feet . . . he was going to die upright like his father, and
he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was
possible. . . .

  
Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the
headstone, Harry stood up . . . he gripped his wand tightly in his
hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the
headstone, facing Voldemort.
Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, “Expelliarmus!” Voldemort cried, “Avada Kedavra!”
A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just as a jet of
red light blasted from Harry’s — they met in midair — and suddenly Harry’s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were
surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldn’t have
released it if he’d wanted to — and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold.
Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that
Voldemort’s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was
shaking and vibrating.
And then — nothing could have prepared Harry for this — he
felt his feet lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both
being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread
of shimmering golden light. They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort’s father and then came to rest on a patch of
ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters
were shouting; they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they
were closing in, reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort,
the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their
wands —
The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered;
though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams
arced high over Harry and Voldemort, crisscrossing all around
them, until they were enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, a

  
cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals,
their cries strangely muffled now. . . .
“Do nothing!” Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and
Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry’s; Harry held onto his wand more tightly,
with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. “Do
nothing unless I command you!” Voldemort shouted to the Death
Eaters.
And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. . . . It
was coming from every thread of the light-spun web vibrating
around Harry and Voldemort. It was a sound Harry recognized,
though he had heard it only once before in his life: phoenix song.
It was the sound of hope to Harry . . . the most beautiful and
welcome thing he had ever heard in his life. . . . He felt as though
the song were inside him instead of just around him. . . . It was the
sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as
though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . .
Don’t break the connection.
I know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn’t . . . but no
sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to
do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever . . . and
now the beam between him and Voldemort changed too . . . it was
as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread
connecting the wands — Harry felt his wand give a shudder under
his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his
way. . . . The direction of the beam’s movement was now toward
him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily. . . .
As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harry’s wand tip,

  
the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst
into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry’s wand
vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it;
it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers —
He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the
bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes
furious, fixed . . . and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a
halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way . . .
and it was Voldemort’s wand that was vibrating extra-hard now . . .
Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful. . . .
One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of
Voldemort’s wand. Harry didn’t understand why he was doing it,
didn’t know what it might achieve . . . but he now concentrated as
he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back
into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . . very slowly . . . it moved
along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a moment. . . and then
it connected. . . .
At once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing screams of
pain . . . then — Voldemort’s red eyes widened with shock — a
dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished . . . the
ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail . . . more shouts of
pain . . . and then something much larger began to blossom from
Voldemort’s wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as
though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . . It was a
head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would
have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly,
so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though
the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? it looked so

  
solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort’s wand, as
though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel . . . and
this shade of Cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden
thread of light, and spoke.
“Hold on, Harry,” it said.
Its voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort . . . his wide red eyes were still shocked . . . he had no more
expected this than Harry had . . . and, very dimly, Harry heard the
frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of
the golden dome. . . .
More screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something
else emerged from its tip . . . the dense shadow of a second head,
quickly followed by arms and torso . . . an old man Harry had seen
only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the
wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or
whatever it was, fell next to Cedric’s, and surveyed Harry and
Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with
mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick. . . .
“He was a real wizard, then?” the old man said, his eyes on
Voldemort. “Killed me, that one did. . . . You fight him, boy. . . .”
But already, yet another head was emerging . . . and this head,
gray as a smoky statue, was a woman’s. . . . Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the
ground and straighten up like the others, staring. . . .
The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with
wide eyes.
“Don’t let go, now!” she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedric’s
as though from very far away. “Don’t let him get you, Harry —
don’t let go!”

  
She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the
inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around
the outside of it . . . and Voldemort’s dead victims whispered as
they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to
Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn’t hear to Voldemort.
And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemort’s wand . . . and Harry knew when he saw it who it would
be . . . he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment
when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . . knew, because the
woman was the one he’d thought of more than any other
tonight. . . .
The smoky shadow of a young woman with long hair fell to the
ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him . . .
and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the
ghostly face of his mother.
“Your father’s coming . . .” she said quietly. “Hold on for your
father . . . it will be all right . . . hold on. . . .”
And he came . . . first his head, then his body . . . tall and
untidy-haired like Harry, the smoky, shadowy form of James Potter
blossomed from the end of Voldemort’s wand, fell to the ground,
and straightened like his wife. He walked close to Harry, looking
down at him, and he spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as
the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with
fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear. . . .
“When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments . . . but we will give you time . . . you must get to the
Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts . . . do you understand,
Harry?”

  
“Yes,” Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand,
which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers.
“Harry . . .” whispered the figure of Cedric, “take my body back,
will you? Take my body back to my parents. . . .”
“I will,” said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand.
“Do it now,” whispered his father’s voice, “be ready to run . . .
do it now. . . .”
“NOW!” Harry yelled; he didn’t think he could have held on for
another moment anyway — he pulled his wand upward with an
almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light
vanished, the phoenix song died — but the shadowy figures of
Voldemort’s victims did not disappear — they were closing in
upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze —
And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two
stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the
headstones — he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward
Cedric’s body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do —
“Stun him!” he heard Voldemort scream.
Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to
avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the
spells hit it. Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from
behind the angel —
“Impedimenta!” he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his
shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him.
From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of
them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the

  
cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets
of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab
Cedric’s arm —
“Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!” shrieked Voldemort.
Harry’s hand had closed on Cedric’s wrist; one tombstone stood
between him and Voldemort, but Cedric was too heavy to carry,
and the cup was out of reach —
Voldemort’s red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his
mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand.
“Accio!” Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup.
It flew into the air and soared toward him. Harry caught it by
the handle —
He heard Voldemort’s scream of fury at the same moment that
he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had
worked — it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color,
and Cedric along with him. . . . They were going back.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - F I V E
VERITASERU M

Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was
pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his nostrils. He
had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept
them closed now. He did not move. All the breath seemed to have
been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he felt
as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a
ship. To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two
things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Triwizard Cup and Cedric’s body. He felt as though he would slide
away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let
go of either of them. Shock and exhaustion kept him on the
ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting . . . waiting for
someone to do something . . . something to happen . . . and all the
while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. . . .
A torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were
voices everywhere, footsteps, screams. . . . He remained where he
was, his face screwed up against the noise, as though it were a
nightmare that would pass. . . .
Then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over.
“Harry! Harry!”
He opened his eyes.
He was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus Dumbledore was
crouched over him. The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed
in around them, pushing nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath his
head reverberating with their footsteps.
He had come back to the edge of the maze. He could see the
stands rising above him, the shapes of people moving in them, the
stars above.
Harry let go of the cup, but he clutched Cedric to him even
more tightly. He raised his free hand and seized Dumbledore’s
wrist, while Dumbledore’s face swam in and out of focus.
“He’s back,” Harry whispered. “He’s back. Voldemort.”
“What’s going on? What’s happened?”
The face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down over Harry;
it looked white, appalled.
“My God — Diggory!” it whispered. “Dumbledore — he’s dead!”
The words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on
them gasped it to those around them . . . and then others shouted
it — screeched it — into the night — “He’s dead!” “He’s dead!”
“Cedric Diggory! Dead!”
“Harry, let go of him,” he heard Fudge’s voice say, and he felt
fingers trying to pry him from Cedric’s limp body, but Harry
wouldn’t let him go. Then Dumbledore’s face, which was still
blurred and misted, came closer.
“Harry, you can’t help him now. It’s over. Let go.”

  
“He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry muttered — it
seemed important to explain this. “He wanted me to bring him
back to his parents. . . .”
“That’s right, Harry . . . just let go now. . . .”
Dumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary strength for a
man so old and thin, raised Harry from the ground and set him on
his feet. Harry swayed. His head was pounding. His injured leg
would no longer support his weight. The crowd around them jostled,
fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him — “What’s happened?” “What’s wrong with him?” “Diggory’s dead!”
“He’ll need to go to the hospital wing!” Fudge was saying loudly.
“He’s ill, he’s injured — Dumbledore, Diggory’s parents, they’re
here, they’re in the stands. . . .”
“I’ll take Harry, Dumbledore, I’ll take him —”
“No, I would prefer —”
“Dumbledore, Amos Diggory’s running . . . he’s coming over. . . .
Don’t you think you should tell him — before he sees — ?”
“Harry, stay here —”
Girls were screaming, sobbing hysterically. . . . The scene flickered oddly before Harry’s eyes. . . .
“It’s all right, son, I’ve got you . . . come on . . . hospital wing . . .”
“Dumbledore said stay,” said Harry thickly, the pounding in his
scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse than ever.
“You need to lie down. . . . Come on now. . . .”
Someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling, half
carrying him through the frightened crowd. Harry heard people
gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him

  
pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle. Across
the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard
nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.
“What happened, Harry?” the man asked at last as he lifted
Harry up the stone steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. It was Mad-Eye
Moody.
“Cup was a Portkey,” said Harry as they crossed the entrance
hall. “Took me and Cedric to a graveyard . . . and Voldemort was
there . . . Lord Voldemort . . .”
Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Up the marble stairs . . .
“The Dark Lord was there? What happened then?”
“Killed Cedric . . . they killed Cedric. . . .”
“And then?”
Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Along the corridor . . .
“Made a potion . . . got his body back. . . .”
“The Dark Lord got his body back? He’s returned?”
“And the Death Eaters came . . . and then we dueled. . . .”
“You dueled with the Dark Lord?”
“Got away . . . my wand . . . did something funny. . . . I saw my
mum and dad . . . they came out of his wand. . . .”
“In here, Harry . . . in here, and sit down. . . . You’ll be all right
now . . . drink this. . . .”
Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed
into his hands.
“Drink it . . . you’ll feel better . . . come on, now, Harry, I need
to know exactly what happened. . . .”
Moody helped tip the stuff down Harry’s throat; he coughed, a
peppery taste burning his throat. Moody’s office came into sharper

  
focus, and so did Moody himself. . . . He looked as white as Fudge
had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry’s
face.
“Voldemort’s back, Harry? You’re sure he’s back? How did he
do it?”
“He took stuff from his father’s grave, and from Wormtail, and
me,” said Harry. His head felt clearer; his scar wasn’t hurting so
badly; he could now see Moody’s face distinctly, even though the
office was dark. He could still hear screaming and shouting from
the distant Quidditch field.
“What did the Dark Lord take from you?” said Moody.
“Blood,” said Harry, raising his arm. His sleeve was ripped
where Wormtail’s dagger had torn it.
Moody let out his breath in a long, low hiss.
“And the Death Eaters? They returned?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “Loads of them . . .”
“How did he treat them?” Moody asked quietly. “Did he forgive
them?”
But Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have told
Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway —
“There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There’s a Death Eater
here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I
got through to the end —”
Harry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down.
“I know who the Death Eater is,” he said quietly.
“Karkaroff?” said Harry wildly. “Where is he? Have you got him?
Is he locked up?”
“Karkaroff?” said Moody with an odd laugh. “Karkaroff fled
tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm. He

  
betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to
meet them . . . but I doubt he will get far. The Dark Lord has ways
of tracking his enemies.”
“Karkaroff’s gone? He ran away? But then — he didn’t put my
name in the goblet?”
“No,” said Moody slowly. “No, he didn’t. It was I who did that.”
Harry heard, but didn’t believe.
“No, you didn’t,” he said. “You didn’t do that . . . you can’t have
done . . .”
“I assure you I did,” said Moody, and his magical eye swung
around and fixed upon the door, and Harry knew he was making
sure that there was no one outside it. At the same time, Moody
drew out his wand and pointed it at Harry.
“He forgave them, then?” he said. “The Death Eaters who went
free? The ones who escaped Azkaban?”
“What?” said Harry.
He was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him. This
was a bad joke, it had to be.
“I asked you,” said Moody quietly, “whether he forgave the scum
who never even went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards
who wouldn’t even brave Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless
bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I
fired it into the sky.”
“You fired . . . What are you talking about . . . ?”
“I told you, Harry . . . I told you. If there’s one thing I hate more
than any other, it’s a Death Eater who walked free. They turned
their backs on my master when he needed them most. I expected
him to punish them. I expected him to torture them. Tell me he

  
hurt them, Harry. . . .” Moody’s face was suddenly lit with an insane smile. “Tell me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful . . . prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing
he wanted above all . . . you.”
“You didn’t . . . it — it can’t be you. . . .”
“Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the name of a
different school? I did. Who frightened off every person I thought
might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament? I did. Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons? I
did. Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon?
I did.”
Moody’s magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon
Harry. His lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever.
“It hasn’t been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks
without arousing suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your
success. Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had
managed everything too easily. As long as you got into that maze,
preferably with a decent head start — then, I knew, I would have a
chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way
clear. But I also had to contend with your stupidity. The second
task . . . that was when I was most afraid we would fail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew you hadn’t worked out the egg’s
clue, so I had to give you another hint —”
“You didn’t,” Harry said hoarsely. “Cedric gave me the clue —”
“Who told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I trusted that he
would pass the information on to you. Decent people are so easy
to manipulate, Potter. I was sure Cedric would want to repay you
for telling him about the dragons, and so he did. But even then,

  
Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was watching all the
time . . . all those hours in the library. Didn’t you realize that the
book you needed was in your dormitory all along? I planted it there
early on, I gave it to the Longbottom boy, don’t you remember?
Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would have told you
all you needed to know about gillyweed. I expected you to ask
everyone and anyone you could for help. Longbottom would have
told you in an instant. But you did not . . . you did not. . . . You
have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all.
“So what could I do? Feed you information from another innocent source. You told me at the Yule Ball a house-elf called Dobby
had given you a Christmas present. I called the elf to the staffroom
to collect some robes for cleaning. I staged a loud conversation
with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been
taken, and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed. And your
little elf friend ran straight to Snape’s office and then hurried to
find you. . . .”
Moody’s wand was still pointing directly at Harry’s heart. Over
his shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in the Foe-Glass on the
wall.
“You were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you had
drowned. But luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility,
and marked you high for it. I breathed again.
“You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze
tonight, of course,” said Moody. “I was patrolling around it, able to
see through the outer hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of
your way. I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish Diggory and leave
your path to the cup clear.”

  
Harry stared at Moody. He just didn’t see how this could be. . . .
Dumbledore’s friend, the famous Auror . . . the one who had
caught so many Death Eaters . . . It made no sense . . . no sense at
all. . . .
The foggy shapes in the Foe-Glass were sharpening, had become
more distinct. Harry could see the outlines of three people over
Moody’s shoulder, moving closer and closer. But Moody wasn’t
watching them. His magical eye was upon Harry.
“The Dark Lord didn’t manage to kill you, Potter, and he so
wanted to,” whispered Moody. “Imagine how he will reward me
when he finds I have done it for him. I gave you to him — the
thing he needed above all to regenerate — and then I killed you for
him. I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters. I will be his
dearest, his closest supporter . . . closer than a son. . . .”
Moody’s normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon
Harry. The door was barred, and Harry knew he would never reach
his own wand in time. . . .
“The Dark Lord and I,” said Moody, and he looked completely
insane now, towering over Harry, leering down at him, “have much
in common. Both of us, for instance, had very disappointing
fathers . . . very disappointing indeed. Both of us suffered the indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers. And both of us
had the pleasure . . . the very great pleasure . . . of killing our
fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order!”
“You’re mad,” Harry said — he couldn’t stop himself — “you’re
mad!”
“Mad, am I?” said Moody, his voice rising uncontrollably. “We’ll
see! We’ll see who’s mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned,

  
with me at his side! He is back, Harry Potter, you did not conquer
him — and now — I conquer you!”
Moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry plunged
his own hand into his robes —
“Stupefy!” There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a
great splintering and crashing, the door of Moody’s office was
blasted apart —
Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor. Harry, still
staring at the place where Moody’s face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and Professor McGonagall looking back
at him out of the Foe-Glass. He looked around and saw the three
of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front, his wand
outstretched.
At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why
people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever
feared. The look upon Dumbledore’s face as he stared down at the
unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more terrible than
Harry could have ever imagined. There was no benign smile upon
Dumbledore’s face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles.
There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of
power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off
burning heat.
He stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moody’s
unconscious body, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his
face was visible. Snape followed him, looking into the Foe-Glass,
where his own face was still visible, glaring into the room. Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.
“Come along, Potter,” she whispered. The thin line of her

  
mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. “Come
along . . . hospital wing . . .”
“No,” said Dumbledore sharply.
“Dumbledore, he ought to — look at him — he’s been through
enough tonight —”
“He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand,” said
Dumbledore curtly. “Understanding is the first step to acceptance,
and only with acceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know
who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight, and
why.”
“Moody,” Harry said. He was still in a state of complete disbelief. “How can it have been Moody?”
“This is not Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore quietly. “You
have never known Alastor Moody. The real Moody would not have
removed you from my sight after what happened tonight. The moment he took you, I knew — and I followed.”
Dumbledore bent down over Moody’s limp form and put a
hand inside his robes. He pulled out Moody’s hip flask and a set of
keys on a ring. Then he turned to Professors McGonagall and
Snape.
“Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess,
and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house-elf called
Winky. Minerva, kindly go down to Hagrid’s house, where you will
find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog
up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly, then come back
here.”
If either Snape or McGonagall found these instructions peculiar,
they hid their confusion. Both turned at once and left the office.
Dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the

  
first key in the lock, and opened it. It contained a mass of spellbooks. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second key in the
second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneakoscopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery
Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched, astounded, as Dumbledore
placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective
locks, reopening the trunk, and each time revealing different contents. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the
lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.
He was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room,
and lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep,
thin and starved in appearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His
wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical
eye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled hair
were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping
Moody in the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor
of the office.
Dumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell
lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over
him.
“Stunned — controlled by the Imperius Curse — very weak,”
he said. “Of course, they would have needed to keep him alive.
Harry, throw down the imposter’s cloak — he’s freezing. Madam
Pomfrey will need to see him, but he seems in no immediate
danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in
the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered out of the trunk
again. Then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk,

  
unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick glutinous liquid splattered
onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it, and the brilliance. For Moody never does drink except
from his hip flask, he’s well known for it. The imposter needed, of
course, to keep the real Moody close by, so that he could continue
making the potion. You see his hair . . .” Dumbledore looked down
on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been cutting it off all
year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight,
our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he
should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.”
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon
it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry
stared at him too. Minutes passed in silence. . . .
Then, before Harry’s very eyes, the face of the man on the floor
began to change. The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink.
The long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp
and turning the color of straw. Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the
wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man’s face as a real
eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to
swivel in every direction.
Harry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him
in Dumbledore’s Pensieve, had watched him being led away from
court by the dementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was
innocent . . . but he was lined around the eyes now and looked
much older. . . .

  
There were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had
returned with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right
behind them.
“Crouch!” Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. “Barty
Crouch!”
“Good heavens,” said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and
staring down at the man on the floor.
Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape’s legs. Her
mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek.
“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?”
She flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.
“You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master’s son!”
“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside,
please. Severus, you have the potion?”
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely
clear liquid: the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry
in class. Dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and
pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the
Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and
McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all. Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the man’s mouth open and poured three drops
inside it. Then he pointed his wand at the man’s chest and said,
“Rennervate.”
Crouch’s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused. Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.
“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore asked quietly.
The man’s eyelids flickered.
“Yes,” he muttered.

  
“I would like you to tell us,” said Dumbledore softly, “how you
came to be here. How did you escape from Azkaban?”
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in
a flat, expressionless voice.
“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded
my father to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had
never loved me. He agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a
draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother’s hairs. She
took a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my hairs. We
took on each other’s appearance.”
Winky was shaking her head, trembling.
“Say no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your
father into trouble!”
But Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the
same flat voice.
“The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying
person entering Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father smuggled me out, disguised as my
mother, in case any prisoners were watching through their doors.
“My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was
careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to
be me.”
The man’s eyelids flickered.
“And what did your father do with you, when he had got you
home?” said Dumbledore quietly.
“Staged my mother’s death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave
is empty. The house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be
concealed. I had to be controlled. My father had to use a number

  
of spells to subdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I
thought only of finding my master . . . of returning to his service.”
“How did your father subdue you?” said Dumbledore.
“The Imperius Curse,” Crouch said. “I was under my father’s
control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I
was always with the house-elf. She was my keeper and caretaker.
She pitied me. She persuaded my father to give me occasional
treats. Rewards for my good behavior.”
“Master Barty, Master Barty,” sobbed Winky through her hands.
“You isn’t ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble. . . .”
“Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?” said Dumbledore softly. “Did anyone know except your father and the
house-elf?”
“Yes,” said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. “A witch in my
father’s office. Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers
for my father’s signature. He was not at home. Winky showed her
inside and returned to the kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins heard
Winky talking to me. She came to investigate. She heard enough to
guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak. My father arrived home. She confronted him. He put a very powerful Memory
Charm on her to make her forget what she’d found out. Too powerful. He said it damaged her memory permanently.”
“Why is she coming to nose into my master’s private business?”
sobbed Winky. “Why isn’t she leaving us be?”
“Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,” said Dumbledore.
“Winky talked my father into it,” said Crouch, still in the same
monotonous voice. “She spent months persuading him. I had not
left the house for years. I had loved Quidditch. Let him go, she
said. He will be in his Invisibility Cloak. He can watch. Let him

  
smell fresh air for once. She said my mother would have wanted it.
She told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom.
She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment. He agreed in the
end.
“It was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky up to the
Top Box early in the day. Winky was to say that she was saving a
seat for my father. I was to sit there, invisible. When everyone had
left the box, we would emerge. Winky would appear to be alone.
Nobody would ever know.
“But Winky didn’t know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my father’s Imperius Curse. There were times when I
was almost myself again. There were brief periods when I seemed
outside his control. It happened, there, in the Top Box. It was like
waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of
a boy’s pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it. Winky didn’t know. Winky is frightened of heights.
She had her face hidden.”
“Master Barty, you bad boy!” whispered Winky, tears trickling
between her fingers.
“So you took the wand,” said Dumbledore, “and what did you
do with it?”
“We went back to the tent,” said Crouch. “Then we heard them.
We heard the Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had never suffered for my master. They had
turned their backs on him. They were not enslaved, as I was. They
were free to seek him, but they did not. They were merely making
sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me. My mind
was clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand.

  
I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My
father had left the tent; he had gone to free the Muggles. Winky
was afraid to see me so angry. She used her own brand of magic to
bind me to her. She pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the
forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I
wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show those Death
Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord meant, and to punish them
for their lack of it. I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark
into the sky.
“Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells everywhere. One of the spells came through the trees where Winky and
I stood. The bond connecting us was broken. We were both
Stunned.
“When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be
nearby. He searched the bushes where she had been found and felt
me lying there. He waited until the other Ministry members had
left the forest. He put me back under the Imperius Curse and took
me home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She had let me
acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape.”
Winky let out a wail of despair.
“Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then . . .
and then . . .” Crouch’s head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin
spread across his face. “My master came for me.
“He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant
Wormtail. My master had found out that I was still alive. He had
captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania. He had tortured her. She told
him a great deal. She told him about the Triwizard Tournament.
She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach at Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm

  
my father had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from
Azkaban. She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent
me from seeking my master. And so my master knew that I was still
his faithful servant — perhaps the most faithful of all. My master
conceived a plan, based upon the information Bertha had given
him. He needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight. My
father answered the door.”
The smile spread wider over Crouch’s face, as though recalling
the sweetest memory of his life. Winky’s petrified brown eyes were
visible through her fingers. She seemed too appalled to speak.
“It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius
Curse by my master. Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to go about his business as usual, to
act as though nothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I was
myself again, alive as I hadn’t been in years.
“And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?” said Dumbledore.
“He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I
was ready. It was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to
prove myself to him. He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter
through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so. A
servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the
Triwizard Cup. Turn the cup into a Portkey, which would take the
first person to touch it to my master. But first —”
“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes
were blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion
beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle.

  
There was a commotion. We managed to subdue him just in time.
Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took
some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I became
Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face
Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had
heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I
told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set
off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody’s clothes and Dark
detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be
able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so
that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make
the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me
in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.”
“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?” said
Dumbledore.
“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father’s house,
and to keep watch over my father.”
“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.
“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I
had done. There were periods when he knew what was happening.
My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the
house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He
made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his
duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master
guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to
tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit
that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.

  
“My master sent me word of my father’s escape. He told me to
stop him at all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had
taken from Harry Potter. The map that had almost ruined
everything.”
“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”
“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me
stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He thought I was my father. We have the same first
name. I took the map from Potter that night. I told him my father
hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after Snape.
“For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last,
one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I
pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He
was walking around the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and
Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master needed him.
Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum. I killed my father.”
“Noooo!” wailed Winky. “Master Barty, Master Barty, what is
you saying?”
“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the same soft
voice. “What did you do with the body?”
“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak.
I had the map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He
met Snape. Dumbledore joined them. I watched Potter bringing
Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told Dumbledore
Snape had told me where to come.
“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back
to my father’s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I
Transfigured my father’s body. He became a bone . . . I buried it,

  
while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in
front of Hagrid’s cabin.”
There was complete silence now, except for Winky’s continued
sobs. Then Dumbledore said, “And tonight . . .”
“I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,” whispered Barty Crouch. “Turned it into a Portkey. My master’s plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honored by
him beyond the dreams of wizards.”
The insane smile lit his features once more, and his head
drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - S I X
THE PARTING OF
THE WAYS

Dumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a
moment with disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand
once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves
around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He turned to Professor
McGonagall.
“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry
upstairs?”
“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly
nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick.
However, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty
Crouch, her hand was quite steady.
“Severus” — Dumbledore turned to Snape — “please tell Madam
Pomfrey to come down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into
the hospital wing. Then go down into the grounds, find Cornelius
Fudge, and bring him up to this office. He will undoubtedly want
to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the hospital wing
in half an hour’s time if he needs me.”
Snape nodded silently and swept out of the room.
“Harry?” Dumbledore said gently.
Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had
not noticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor.
“I want you to come up to my office first, Harry,” he said quietly
as they headed up the passageway. “Sirius is waiting for us there.”
Harry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it.
He didn’t want to have to think about anything that had happened
since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn’t want to
have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs,
which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody, inside the
trunk. Wormtail, slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an
arm. Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric . . .
dead . . . Cedric, asking to be returned to his parents. . . .
“Professor,” Harry mumbled, “where are Mr. and Mrs.
Diggory?”
“They are with Professor Sprout,” said Dumbledore. His voice,
which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty
Crouch, shook very slightly for the first time. “She was Head of
Cedric’s house, and knew him best.”
They had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the
password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry went up the moving
spiral staircase to the oak door. Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius
was standing there. His face was white and gaunt as it had been
when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he had
crossed the room.
“Harry, are you all right? I knew it — I knew something like
this — what happened?”
His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the
desk.
“What happened?” he asked more urgently
Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had
said. Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body
was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed,
for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn’t have to think or
feel anymore.
There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his
perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry’s knee.
“ ’Lo, Fawkes,” said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix’s
beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up
at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight.
Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes.
Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make
Harry relive everything.
“I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey
in the maze, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
“We can leave that till morning, can’t we, Dumbledore?” said
Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Let him
have a sleep. Let him rest.”
Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore
took no notice of Sirius’s words. He leaned forward toward Harry.
Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue
eyes.
“If I thought I could help you,” Dumbledore said gently, “by
putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone
the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the pain
for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have
shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask
you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell
us what happened.”
The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the
air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down
his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.
He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before
his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived
Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves
around them; he saw Cedric’s body, lying on the ground beside the
cup.
Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry’s shoulder, but Dumbledore
raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it
was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he
felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted
from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to
keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel
better.
When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger,
however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore
stood up so quickly that Harry started. Dumbledore walked around
the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed them
both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.
“He said my blood would make him stronger than if he’d used
someone else’s,” Harry told Dumbledore. “He said the protection
my — my mother left in me — he’d have it too. And he was
right — he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched
my face.”
For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore’s eyes. But next second, Harry
was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned
to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry
had ever seen him.
“Very well,” he said, sitting down again. “Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue, please.”
Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from
the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort’s
speech to the Death Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.
But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light
had connected his and Voldemort’s wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had
come out of Voldemort’s wand were flooding into his mind. He
could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins . . . his
father . . . his mother . . .
He was glad when Sirius broke the silence.
“The wands connected?” he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. “Why?”
Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was
an arrested look.
“Priori Incantatem,” he muttered.
His eyes gazed into Harry’s and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.
“The Reverse Spell effect?” said Sirius sharply.
“Exactly,” said Dumbledore. “Harry’s wand and Voldemort’s
wand share cores. Each of them contains a feather from the tail of
the same phoenix. This phoenix, in fact,” he added, and he pointed
at the scarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry’s knee.
“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said, amazed.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you
had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four
years ago.”
“So what happens when a wand meets its brother?” said Sirius.
“They will not work properly against each other,” said Dumbledore. “If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to
do battle . . . a very rare effect will take place. One of the wands
will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse. The most recent first . . . and then those which preceded
it. . . .”
He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.
“Which means,” said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry’s
face, “that some form of Cedric must have reappeared.”
Harry nodded again.
“Diggory came back to life?” said Sirius sharply.
“No spell can reawaken the dead,” said Dumbledore heavily. “All
that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of
the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?”
“He spoke to me,” Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again.
“The . . . the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.”
“An echo,” said Dumbledore, “which retained Cedric’s appearance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . .
less recent victims of Voldemort’s wand. . . .”
“An old man,” Harry said, his throat still constricted. “Bertha
Jorkins. And . . .”
“Your parents?” said Dumbledore quietly.
“Yes,” said Harry.
Sirius’s grip on Harry’s shoulder was now so tight it was painful.
“The last murders the wand performed,” said Dumbledore,
nodding. “In reverse order. More would have appeared, of course,
had you maintained the connection. Very well, Harry, these
echoes, these shadows . . . what did they do?”
Harry described how the figures that had emerged from the
wand had prowled the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort
had seemed to fear them, how the shadow of Harry’s father had
told him what to do, how Cedric’s had made its final request.
At this point, Harry found he could not continue. He looked
around at Sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands.
Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The
phoenix had fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head
against Harry’s injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from
its eyes onto the wound left by the spider. The pain vanished. The
skin mended. His leg was repaired.
“I will say it again,” said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into
the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door. “You
have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you
tonight, Harry. You have shown bravery equal to those who died
fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You have shouldered a grown wizard’s burden and found yourself equal to it —
and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect. You will
come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to
the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace . . . Sirius, would you like to stay with him?”
Sirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back into the great
black dog and walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital
wing.
When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs.
Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassedlooking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know
where Harry was and what had happened to him. All of them
whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.
“Harry! Oh Harry!”
She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.
“Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a
moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has
just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace,
and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,” he added,
looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, “you may do so.
But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer,
and certainly not this evening.”
Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron,
Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed,
“Did you hear? He needs quiet!”
“Headmaster,” said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black
dog that was Sirius, “may I ask what — ?”
“This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,” said Dumbledore simply. “I assure you, he is extremely well trained.
Harry — I will wait while you get into bed.”
Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore
for asking the others not to question him. It wasn’t as though he
didn’t want them there; but the thought of explaining it all over
again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could
stand.
“I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge,
Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school.” He left.
As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight
of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the
room. His wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside
table.
“Is he okay?” Harry asked.
“He’ll be fine,” said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled
on the pajamas, and got into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs.
Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled
themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were
looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.
“I’m all right,” he told them. “Just tired.”
Mrs. Weasley’s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarily.
Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned
holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.
“You’ll need to drink all of this, Harry,” she said. “It’s a potion
for dreamless sleep.”
Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything around him became
hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at
him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body
felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather
matress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.
Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his
eyes, wanting to drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was
sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have
been asleep very long.
Then he heard whispering around him.
“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!”
“What are they shouting about? Nothing else can have happened, can it?”
Harry opened his eyes blearily Someone had removed his
glasses. He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill
close by. Mrs. Weasley was on her feet.
“That’s Fudge’s voice,” she whispered. “And that’s Minerva
McGonagall’s, isn’t it? But what are they arguing about?”
Now Harry could hear them too: people shouting and running
toward the hospital wing.
“Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva —” Cornelius Fudge
was saying loudly.
“You should never have brought it inside the castle!” yelled Professor McGonagall. “When Dumbledore finds out —”
Harry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed by any of
the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as
Bill pulled back the screens, Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.
Fudge came striding up the ward. Professors McGonagall and
Snape were at his heels.
“Where’s Dumbledore?” Fudge demanded of Mrs. Weasley.
“He’s not here,” said Mrs. Weasley angrily. “This is a hospital
wing, Minister, don’t you think you’d do better to —”
But the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping up the
ward.
“What has happened?” said Dumbledore sharply, looking from
Fudge to Professor McGonagall. “Why are you disturbing these
people? Minerva, I’m surprised at you — I asked you to stand
guard over Barty Crouch —”
“There is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumbledore!” she shrieked. “The Minister has seen to that!”
Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like
this. There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and her
hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.
“When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater
responsible for tonight’s events,” said Snape, in a low voice, “he
seemed to feel his personal safety was in question. He insisted on
summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle. He
brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch —”
“I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!” Professor
McGonagall fumed. “I told him you would never allow dementors
to set foot inside the castle, but —”
“My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier
than Harry had ever seen him, “as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous —”
But Professor McGonagall’s voice drowned Fudge’s.
“The moment that — that thing entered the room,” she
screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down
on Crouch and — and —”
Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need
her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have
done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had
sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.
“By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It seems he has
been responsible for several deaths!”
“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly
for the first time. “He cannot give evidence about why he killed
those people.”
“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery, is it?” blustered
Fudge. “He was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus
have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on YouKnow-Who’s instructions!”
“Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,”
Dumbledore said. “Those people’s deaths were mere by-products
of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body.”
Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight
into his face. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as
if he couldn’t quite believe what he had just heard. He began to
sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.
“You-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore . . .”
“As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,” said Dumbledore, “we heard Barry Crouch confess. Under the influence of
Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and
how Voldemort — learning of his continued existence from Bertha
Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.”
“See here, Dumbledore,” said Fudge, and Harry was astonished
to see a slight smile dawning on his face, “you — you can’t seriously believe that. You-Know-Who — back? Come now, come
now . . . certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting
upon You-Know-Who’s orders — but to take the word of a lunatic
like that, Dumbledore . . .”
“When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,” said Dumbledore steadily. “He witnessed Lord Voldemort’s rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you
will step up to my office.”
Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was
awake, but shook his head and said, “I am afraid I cannot permit
you to question Harry tonight.”
Fudge’s curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then
looked back at Dumbledore, and said, “You are — er — prepared
to take Harry’s word on this, are you, Dumbledore?”
There was a moment’s silence, which was broken by Sirius
growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at
Fudge.
“Certainly, I believe Harry,” said Dumbledore. His eyes were
blazing now. “I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard Harry’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the
two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened
since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.”
Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he
glanced at Harry before answering.
“You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned,
on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well . . .”
Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.
“You’ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,” he said quietly.
Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of
them had realized that Harry was awake.
Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came
over his face.
“And if I have?” he said, looking at Dumbledore. “If I have discovered that you’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very
quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the
place —”
“I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?” said Dumbledore coolly.
“You admit that he has been having these pains, then?” said Fudge
quickly. “Headaches? Nightmares? Possibly — hallucinations?”
“Listen to me, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable
sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned
young Crouch. “Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his
forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when
Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous.”
Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he
looked no less stubborn.
“You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard of a curse
scar acting as an alarm bell before. . . .”
“Look, I saw Voldemort come back!” Harry shouted. He tried to
get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. “I saw the
Death Eaters! I can give you their names! Lucius Malfoy —”
Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him,
Snape’s eyes flew back to Fudge.
“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A very old
family — donations to excellent causes —”
“Macnair!” Harry continued.
“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”
“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle —”
“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily.
“You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For
heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot
story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting taller, and
you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy?”
“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric Diggory! Mr.
Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!”
“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, 
his face purpling. “It seems to me that you are all
determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have
worked for these last thirteen years!”
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had always
thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little
pompous, but essentially good-natured. But now a short, angry
wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the
prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world — to
believe that Voldemort could have risen.
“Voldemort has returned,” Dumbledore repeated. “If you accept
that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we
may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential
step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors —”
“Preposterous!” shouted Fudge again. “Remove the dementors?
I’d be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe
in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing
guard at Azkaban!”
“The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort’s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks
them!” said Dumbledore. “They will not remain loyal to you,
Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind
him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hardpressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen
years ago!”
Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words
could express his outrage.
“The second step you must take — and at once,” Dumbledore
pressed on, “is to send envoys to the giants.”
“Envoys to the giants?” Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue
again. “What madness is this?”
“Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,”
said Dumbledore, “or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and
their freedom!”
“You — you cannot be serious!” Fudge gasped, shaking his head
and retreating further from Dumbledore. “If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate
them, Dumbledore — end of my career —”
“You are blinded,” said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the
aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more,
“by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius! You place too much
importance, and you always have done, on the so-called purity of
blood! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is
born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has just destroyed
the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any —
and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now —
take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in
office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic
we have ever known. Fail to act — and history will remember you
as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second
chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!”
“Insane,” whispered Fudge, still backing away. “Mad . . .”
And then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing
frozen at the foot of Harry’s bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs.
Weasley was still standing over Harry, her hand on his shoulder to
prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at
Fudge.
“If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as
this, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, “we have reached a parting of
the ways. You must act as you see fit. And I — I shall act as I see
fit.”
Dumbledore’s voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a
mere statement, but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were
advancing upon him with a wand.
“Now, see here, Dumbledore,” he said, waving a threatening finger. “I’ve given you free rein, always. I’ve had a lot of respect for
you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I’ve
kept quiet. There aren’t many who’d have let you hire werewolves,
or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry. But if you’re going to work against me —”
“The only one against whom I intend to work,” said Dumbledore, “is Lord Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain,
Cornelius, on the same side.”
It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked
backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his
bowler hat in his hands. Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his
voice, “He can’t be back, Dumbledore, he just can’t be . . .”
Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left
sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed
it to Fudge, who recoiled.
“There,” said Snape harshly. “There. The Dark Mark. It is not as
clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can
still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the
Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his
means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of
any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly,
at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff’s
too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the
Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the
Dark Lord’s vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death
Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.”
Fudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head.
He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared,
apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape’s arm, then looked
up at Dumbledore and whispered, “I don’t know what you and
your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I
have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the
Ministry.”
He had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned
around, strode back down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry’s
bed.
“Your winnings,” he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out
of his pocket and dropping it onto Harry’s bedside table. “One
thousand Galleons. There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances . . .”
He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the
room, slamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry’s
bed.
“There is work to be done,” he said. “Molly . . . am I right in
thinking that I can count on you and Arthur?”
“Of course you can,” said Mrs. Weasley. She was white to the
lips, but she looked resolute. “We know what Fudge is. It’s Arthur’s
fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all
these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.”
“Then I need to send a message to Arthur,” said Dumbledore.
“All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry
who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius.”
“I’ll go to Dad,” said Bill, standing up. “I’ll go now.”
“Excellent,” said Dumbledore. “Tell him what has happened. Tell
him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry —”
“Leave it to me,” said Bill.
He clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, kissed his mother on the
cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.
“Minerva,” said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall,
“I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also — if
she will consent to come — Madame Maxime.”
Professor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.
“Poppy,” Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, “would you be
very kind and go down to Professor Moody’s office, where I think
you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do
what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think
Dobby will look after her for us.”
“Very — very well,” said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and
she too left.
Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that
Madam Pomfrey’s footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.
“And now,” he said, “it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are. Sirius . . . if you could resume
your usual form.”
The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.
Mrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.
“Sirius Black!” she shrieked, pointing at him.
“Mum, shut up!” Ron yelled. “It’s okay!”
Snape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his
face was one of mingled fury and horror.
“Him!” he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal
dislike. “What is he doing here?”
“He is here at my invitation,” said Dumbledore, looking between them, “as are you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you
to lay aside your old differences and trust each other.”
Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius
and Snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.
“I will settle, in the short term,” said Dumbledore, with a bite of
impatience in his voice, “for a lack of open hostility. You will shake
hands. You are on the same side now. Time is short, and unless the
few of us who know the truth do not stand united, there is no hope
for any of us.”
Very slowly — but still glaring at each other as though each
wished the other nothing but ill — Sirius and Snape moved toward
each other and shook hands. They let go extremely quickly.
“That will do to be going on with,” said Dumbledore, stepping
between them once more. “Now I have work for each of you.
Fudge’s attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin,
Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd. Lie low at
Lupins for a while; I will contact you there.”
“But —” said Harry.
He wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly.
“You’ll see me very soon, Harry,” said Sirius, turning to him. “I
promise you. But I must do what I can, you understand, don’t
you?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . of course I do.”
Sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again into the black dog, and ran the length of the room
to the door, whose handle he turned with a paw. Then he was
gone.
“Severus,” said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, “you know what
I must ask you to do. If you are ready . . . if you are prepared . . .”
“I am,” said Snape.
He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.
“Then good luck,” said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a
trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after
Sirius.
It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.
“I must go downstairs,” he said finally. “I must see the Diggorys.
Harry — take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.”
Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared. 
Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at
him. None of them spoke for a very long time.
“You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley
said at last. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet. “You have a good
long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while . . .
think about what you’re going to buy with your winnings!”
“I don’t want that gold,” said Harry in an expressionless voice.
“You have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn’t have won it. It
should’ve been Cedric’s.”
The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever
since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower
him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners
of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.
“It wasn’t your fault, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley whispered.
“I told him to take the cup with me,” said Harry.
Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron
would look away.
Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent
down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever
being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of
everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as
Mrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother’s face, his father’s voice,
the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his
head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face
against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.
There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry
broke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand.
“Sorry,” she whispered.
“Your potion, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley quickly, wiping her
eyes on the back of her hand.
Harry drank it in one gulp. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy,
irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him; he fell back
onto his pillows and thought no more.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - S E V E N
THE BEGINNING

When he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he
had only scattered memories of the next few days. It was
as though he had been through too much to take in any more. The
recollections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps,
was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following
morning.
They did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric’s body to them. Mr.
Diggory sobbed through most of the interview. Mrs. Diggory’s
grief seemed to be beyond tears.
“He suffered very little then,” she said, when Harry had told her
how Cedric had died. “And after all, Amos . . . he died just when
he’d won the tournament. He must have been happy.”
When they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said,
“You look after yourself, now.”
Harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.
W

  
“You take this,” he muttered to her. “It should’ve been Cedric’s,
he got there first, you take it —”
But she backed away from him.
“Oh no, it’s yours, dear, I couldn’t . . . you keep it.”
Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From
what Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the
school that morning at breakfast. He had merely requested that
they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger
him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his
eyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed. He guessed
that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter’s article about how
disturbed and possibly dangerous he was. Perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric had died. He found
he didn’t care very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron
and Hermione and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess. He felt as though all
three of them had reached an understanding they didn’t need to
put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of
what was going on outside Hogwarts — and that it was useless to
speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything
for certain. The only time they touched upon the subject was when
Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.
“She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer,” he said. “But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least
at first.”
“Why?” said Harry.

  
“She said Dumbledore’s got his reasons,” said Ron, shaking his
head darkly. “I suppose we’ve got to trust him, haven’t we?”
The only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt
able to talk to was Hagrid. As there was no longer a Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher, they had those lessons free. They used the
one on Thursday afternoon to go down and visit Hagrid in his
cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded out of the open
door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly.
“Who’s that?” called Hagrid, coming to the door. “Harry!”
He strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one-armed
hug, ruffled his hair, and said, “Good ter see yeh, mate. Good ter
see yeh.”
They saw two bucket-size cups and saucers on the wooden table
in front of the fireplace when they entered Hagrid’s cabin.
“Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe,” Hagrid said. “She’s jus’ left.”
“Who?” said Ron curiously.
“Madame Maxime, o’ course!” said Hagrid.
“You two made up, have you?” said Ron.
“Dunno what yeh’re talkin’ about,” said Hagrid airily, fetching
more cups from the dresser. When he had made tea and offered
around a plate of doughy cookies, he leaned back in his chair and
surveyed Harry closely through his beetle-black eyes.
“You all righ’?” he said gruffly.
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“No, yeh’re not,” said Hagrid. “ ’Course yeh’re not. But yeh will
be.”
Harry said nothing.
“Knew he was goin’ ter come back,” said Hagrid, and Harry,

  
Ron, and Hermione looked up at him, shocked. “Known it fer
years, Harry. Knew he was out there, bidin’ his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has, an’ we’ll jus’ have ter get on with it. We’ll
fight. Migh’ be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. That’s
Dumbledore’s plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore. ’S long as
we’ve got him, I’m not too worried.”
Hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions
on their faces.
“No good sittin’ worryin’ abou’ it,” he said. “What’s comin’ will
come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does. Dumbledore told me wha’ you
did, Harry.”
Hagrid’s chest swelled as he looked at Harry.
“Yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ I can’ give yeh
no higher praise than that.”
Harry smiled back at him. It was the first time he’d smiled in
days. “What’s Dumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid?” he asked.
“He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime
to meet him — that night.”
“Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said Hagrid. “Secret,
though. I’m not s’pposed ter talk abou’ it, no, not even ter you lot.
Olympe — Madame Maxime ter you — might be comin’ with
me. I think she will. Think I got her persuaded.”
“Is it to do with Voldemort?”
Hagrid flinched at the sound of the name.
“Migh’ be,” he said evasively. “Now . . . who’d like ter come an’
visit the las’ skrewt with me? I was jokin’ — jokin’!” he added
hastily, seeing the looks on their faces.

  
It was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the
dormitory on the night before his return to Privet Drive. He was
dreading the Leaving Feast, which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter-House Championship would be
announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall when it was
full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when
it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.
When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at
once that the usual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was
normally decorated with the winning House’s colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall
behind the teachers’ table. Harry knew instantly that they were
there as a mark of respect to Cedric.
The real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden
leg and his magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy,
jumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry couldn’t blame
him; Moody’s fear of attack was bound to have been increased by
his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. Professor Karkaroff’s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with the
other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with him.
Madame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid.
They were talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting
next to Professor McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on
Harry for a moment as Harry looked at him. His expression was
difficult to read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry
continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away.
What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledore’s orders, the
night that Voldemort had returned? And why . . . why . . . was

  
Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was truly on their side? He
had been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape
had turned spy against Voldemort, “at great personal risk.” Was
that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the
Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone
over to Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself,
biding his time?
Harry’s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who
stood up at the staff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had
been less noisy than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became
very quiet.
“The end,” said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, “of
another year.”
He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs
had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet,
and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall.
“There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,” said
Dumbledore, “but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine
person, who should be sitting here,” he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, “enjoying our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to
stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.”
They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the
Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low,
rumbling voice, “Cedric Diggory.”
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were
tears pouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table
as they all sat down again.
“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that
distinguish Hufflepuff house,” Dumbledore continued. “He was a

  
good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death
has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. I think that
you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.”
Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.
“Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”
A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at
Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he
watched them mutter themselves into silence.
“The Ministry of Magic,” Dumbledore continued, “does not
wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will
be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I
should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however,
that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to
pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort
of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.”
Stunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned toward
Dumbledore now . . . or almost every face. Over at the Slytherin
table, Harry saw Draco Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and
Goyle. Harry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach. He
forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.
“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection
with Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went on. “I am talking, of course,
about Harry Potter.”
A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in
Harry’s direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore.
“Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,” said Dumbledore. “He risked his own life to return Cedric’s body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few

  
wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I
honor him.”
Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once
more. Nearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric’s, and drank to
him. But through a gap in the standing figures, Harry saw that
Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had
remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.
When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued, “The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further
and promote magical understanding. In the light of what has happened — of Lord Voldemort’s return — such ties are more important than ever before.”
Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to
Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor
Krum and the Durmstrangs at the Slytherin table. Krum, Harry
saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh.
“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “will be welcomed back
here at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all, once
again — in the light of Lord Voldemort’s return, we are only as
strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can
fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and
trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our
aims are identical and our hearts are open.
“It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am mis-

  
taken — that we are all facing dark and difficult times. Some of
you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord
Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn asunder. A week
ago, a student was taken from our midst.
“Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when
you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy,
remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and
brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”
Harry’s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of
it. He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance
hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would
take them back to Hogsmeade station. It was another beautiful
summer’s day. He supposed that Privet Drive would be hot and
leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that
evening. The thought gave him no pleasure at all.
“ ’Arry!”
He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone
steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds, Harry
could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The Beauxbatons carriage was about
to take off.
“We will see each uzzer again, I ’ope,” said Fleur as she reached
him, holding out her hand. “I am ’oping to get a job ’ere, to improve my Eenglish.”
“It’s very good already,” said Ron in a strangled sort of voice.
Fleur smiled at him; Hermione scowled.

  
“Good-bye, ’Arry,” said Fleur, turning to go. “It ’az been a pleasure meeting you!”
Harry’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur
hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair
rippling in the sunlight.
“Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,” said
Ron. “D’you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?”
“Karkaroff did not steer,” said a gruff voice. “He stayed in his
cabin and let us do the vork.”
Krum had come to say good-bye to Hermione.
“Could I have a vord?” he asked her.
“Oh . . . yes . . . all right,” said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent
the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see
what Krum and Hermione might be up to. They returned quite
soon. Ron stared at Hermione, but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays
polite to me. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with
Karkaroff,” he added, scowling.
“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.
Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook
Harry’s hand, and then Ron’s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle. Krum had already started
walking away when Ron burst out, “Can I have your autograph?”
Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that

  
 were now trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking
surprised but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for Ron.
The weather could not have been more different on the journey
back to King’s Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the
previous September. There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Ron’s dress robes
to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her
head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare
seat like a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped
them southward. Harry felt as though Dumbledore’s speech at the
Leaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to
discuss what had happened now. They broke off their conversation
about what action Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop
Voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived.
When Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money
back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet
that she had been carrying in there. Harry looked at it, unsure
whether he really wanted to know what it might say, but Hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, “There’s nothing in
there. You can look for yourself, but there’s nothing at all. I’ve been
checking every day. Just a small piece the day after the third task
saying you won the tournament. They didn’t even mention Cedric.
Nothing about any of it. If you ask me, Fudge is forcing them to
keep quiet.”
“He’ll never keep Rita quiet,” said Harry. “Not on a story like
this.”

  
“Oh, Rita hasn’t written anything at all since the third task,” said
Hermione in an oddly constrained voice. “As a matter of fact,” she
added, her voice now trembling slightly, “Rita Skeeter isn’t going to
be writing anything at all for a while. Not unless she wants me to
spill the beans on her.”
“What are you talking about?” said Ron.
“I found out how she was listening in on private conversations
when she wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,” said
Hermione in a rush.
Harry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell
them this for days, but that she had restrained herself in light of
everything else that had happened.
“How was she doing it?” said Harry at once.
“How did you find out?” said Ron, staring at her.
“Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea, Harry,” she said.
“Did I?” said Harry, perplexed. “How?”
“Bugging,” said Hermione happily.
“But you said they didn’t work —”
“Oh not electronic bugs,” said Hermione. “No, you see . . . Rita
Skeeter” — Hermione’s voice trembled with quiet triumph — “is an
unregistered Animagus. She can turn —”
Hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out of her bag.
“— into a beetle.”
“You’re kidding,” said Ron. “You haven’t . . . she’s not . . .”
“Oh yes she is,” said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at
them.
Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle.
“That’s never — you’re kidding —” Ron whispered, lifting the
jar to his eyes.

  
“No, I’m not,” said Hermione, beaming. “I caught her on the
windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul
glasses she wears.”
Harry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered something.
“There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid
telling Madame Maxime about his mum!”
“Exactly,” said Hermione. “And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my
hair after we’d had our conversation by the lake. And unless I’m
very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the
Divination class the day your scar hurt. She’s been buzzing around
for stories all year.”
“When we saw Malfoy under that tree . . .” said Ron slowly.
“He was talking to her, in his hand,” said Hermione. “He knew,
of course. That’s how she’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn’t care that she was doing
something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff
about us and Hagrid.”
Hermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the
beetle, which buzzed angrily against the glass.
“I’ve told her I’ll let her out when we get back to London,” said
Hermione. “I’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so
she can’t transform. And I’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people.”
Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her
schoolbag.
The door of the compartment slid open.

  
“Very clever, Granger,” said Draco Malfoy.
Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them
looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more
menacing, than Harry had ever seen them.
“So,” said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his
lips. “You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter’s Dumbledore’s favorite boy again. Big deal.”
His smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.
“Trying not to think about it, are we?” said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. “Trying to pretend it hasn’t
happened?”
“Get out,” said Harry.
He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him
muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore’s speech
about Cedric. He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand
gripped his wand under his robes.
“You’ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you
you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember?
When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to
hang around with riffraff like this!” He jerked his head at Ron and
Hermione. “Too late now, Potter! They’ll be the first to go, now the
Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well — second — Diggory was the f —”
It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks
within the compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that
had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs,
Harry blinked and looked down at the floor.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the

  
doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of
them having used a different hex. Nor were they the only ones to
have done so.
“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matterof-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had
his wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
“Interesting effect,” said George, looking down at Crabbe.
“Who used the Furnunculus Curse?”
“Me,” said Harry.
“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though
those two shouldn’t be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well, let’s not leave them here, they don’t
add much to the decor.”
Ron, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle — each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been
hit — out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment
and rolled the door shut.
“Exploding Snap, anyone?” said Fred, pulling out a pack of
cards.
They were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them.
“You going to tell us, then?” he said to George. “Who you were
blackmailing?”
“Oh,” said George darkly. “That.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. “It
wasn’t anything important. Not now, anyway.”
“We’ve given up,” said George, shrugging.

  
But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred
said, “All right, all right, if you really want to know . . . it was Ludo
Bagman.”
“Bagman?” said Harry sharply. “Are you saying he was involved
in —”
“Nah,” said George gloomily. “Nothing like that. Stupid git. He
wouldn’t have the brains.”
“Well, what, then?” said Ron.
Fred hesitated, then said, “You remember that bet we had with
him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win,
but Krum would get the Snitch?”
“Yeah,” said Harry and Ron slowly.
“Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he’d caught from the
Irish mascots.”
“So?”
“So,” said Fred impatiently, “it vanished, didn’t it? By next
morning, it had gone!”
“But — it must’ve been an accident, mustn’t it?” said Hermione.
George laughed very bitterly.
“Yeah, that’s what we thought, at first. We thought if we just
wrote to him, and told him he’d made a mistake, he’d cough up.
But nothing doing. Ignored our letter. We kept trying to talk to
him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse
to get away from us.”
“In the end, he turned pretty nasty,” said Fred. “Told us we were
too young to gamble, and he wasn’t giving us anything.”
“So we asked for our money back,” said George glowering.
“He didn’t refuse!” gasped Hermione.
“Right in one,” said Fred.

  
“But that was all your savings!” said Ron.
“Tell me about it,” said George. “ ’Course, we found out what
was going on in the end. Lee Jordan’s dad had had a bit of trouble
getting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he’s in big trouble
with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them
cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the
gold he had, and it still wasn’t enough to cover all his debts. They
followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He’s
lost everything gambling. Hasn’t got two Galleons to rub together.
And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?”
“How?” said Harry.
“He put a bet on you, mate,” said Fred. “Put a big bet on you to
win the tournament. Bet against the goblins.”
“So that’s why he kept trying to help me win!” said Harry.
“Well — I did win, didn’t I? So he can pay you your gold!”
“Nope,” said George, shaking his head. “The goblins play as
dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was
betting you’d win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He did
run for it right after the third task.”
George sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.
The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished
it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never
arrive at King’s Cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that
year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies
ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at
platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise
filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and
Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying
their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.

  
“Fred — George — wait a moment.”
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his
Triwizard winnings.
“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.
“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.
“Take it,” Harry repeated firmly. “I don’t want it.”
“You’re mental,” said George, trying to push it back at Harry.
“No, I’m not,” said Harry. “You take it, and get inventing. It’s
for the joke shop.”
“He is mental,” Fred said in an almost awed voice.
“Listen,” said Harry firmly. “If you don’t take it, I’m throwing it
down the drain. I don’t want it and I don’t need it. But I could do
with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I’ve got a feeling we’re going to need them more than usual before long.”
“Harry,” said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his
hands, “there’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “Think how many Canary Creams
that is.”
The twins stared at him.
“Just don’t tell your mum where you got it . . . although she
might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore, come
to think of it. . . .”
“Harry,” Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.
“Look,” he said flatly, “take it, or I’ll hex you. I know some good
ones now. Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress
robes and say they’re from you.”
He left the compartment before they could say another word,
stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on
the floor, covered in hex marks.
Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was
close by him. She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and
whispered in his ear, “I think Dumbledore will let you come to us
later in the summer. Keep in touch, Harry.”
“See you, Harry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.
“ ’Bye, Harry!” said Hermione, and she did something she had
never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.
“Harry — thanks,” George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side.
Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed
him silently from the station. There was no point worrying yet, he
told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys’ car.
As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come . . . and he
would have to meet it when it did.
