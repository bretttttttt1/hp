THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE

Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support for
his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had
overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express.
“But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn’t he?” interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything.
“Well,” she said uncertainly, “I don’t know. . . . It would be like
Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is . . . but
that’s a big lie to tell. . . .”
“Exactly,” said Harry, but he could not press the point, because
so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to
mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands.
“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule
first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait
hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry
behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled
out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered.
“I love being a sixth year. And we’re going to be getting free time
this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.”
“We’re going to need that time for studying, Ron!” said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor.
“Yeah, but not today,” said Ron. “Today’s going to be a real doss,
I reckon.”
“Hold it!” said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a
passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a
lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. “Fanged Frisbees are
banned, hand it over,” she told him sternly. The scowling boy
handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took
off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the
Frisbee from Hermione’s grip.
“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.”
Hermione’s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron’s remark highly amusing. She
continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over
her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.
The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked
with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through
the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and
eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarrassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.
“But he can’t really think we’d continue Care of Magical Creatures!” she said, looking distressed. “I mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?”
“That’s it, though, innit?” said Ron, swallowing an entire fried
egg whole. “We were the ones who made the most effort in classes
because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject.
D’you reckon anyone’s going to go on to N.E.W.T.?”
Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need.
They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to
continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid’s eye
and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the
staff table ten minutes later.
After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting
Professor McGonagall’s descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year,
for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody
had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their
chosen N.E.W.T.s.
Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms,
Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology,
Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a firstperiod Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor
McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his
O.W.L. results.
“Herbology, fine,” she said. “Professor Sprout will be delighted
to see you back with an ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L. And you qualify for
Defense Against the Dark Arts with ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ But the
problem is Transfiguration. I’m sorry, Longbottom, but an
Acceptable’ really isn’t good enough to continue to N.E.W.T level.
I just don’t think you’d be able to cope with the coursework.”
Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him
through her square spectacles.
“Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway?
I’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.”
Neville looked miserable and muttered something about “my
grandmother wants.”
“Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall. “It’s high time your
grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she’s got, rather
than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after
what happened at the Ministry.”
Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor
McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before.
“I’m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T.
class. I see that you have an ‘Exceeds Expectations’ in Charms,
however — why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?”
“My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,” mumbled
Neville.
“Take Charms,” said Professor McGonagall, “and I shall drop
Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her
Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.” Smiling
slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville’s face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand
and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville.
Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first
question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still
teaching Divination.
“He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them
this year,” said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her
voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of
Divination. “The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.”
Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly
crestfallen.
“So, Potter, Potter . . .” said Professor McGonagall, consulting
her notes as she turned to Harry. “Charms, Defense Against the
Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration . . . all fine. I must say, I was
pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now,
why haven’t you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was
your ambition to become an Auror?”
“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ in my
O.W.L., Professor.”
“And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject.
Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T
students with ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to
proceed with Potions?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn’t buy the books or any ingredients
or anything —”
“I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,” said
Professor McGonagall. “Very well, Potter, here is your schedule.
Oh, by the way — twenty hopefuls have already put down their
names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to
you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.”
A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as
Harry, and the two of them left the table together.
“Look,” said Ron delightedly, gazing at his schedule, “we’ve got
a free period now . . . and a free period after break . . . and after
lunch . . . excellent!”
They returned to the common room, which was empty apart
from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only
remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that
Harry had joined in his first year.
“I thought you’d get that, well done,” she called over, pointing
at the Captain’s badge on Harry’s chest. “Tell me when you call
trials!”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, “you don’t need to try out, I’ve
watched you play for five years. . . .”
“You mustn’t start off like that,” she said warningly. “For all you
know, there’s someone much better than me out there. Good teams
have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing
the old faces, or letting in their friends. . . .”
Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the
Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student.
It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to
take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks’s yellow eyes followed it and
he hissed when it came too close.
An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for
the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below.
Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of
heavy books and looking put-upon.
“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said anxiously,
when Harry and Ron joined her. “A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I’ve got to read these by Wednesday!”
“Shame,” yawned Ron.
“You wait,” she said resentfully. “I bet Snape gives us loads.”
The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped
into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of
greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.
“Inside,” he said.
Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his
personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as
curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely
contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking
around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.
“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk;
Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back
into her bag and stowed it under her chair. “I wish to speak to you,
and I want your fullest attention.”
His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a
fraction of a second longer on Harry’s than anyone else’s.
“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.”
You believe . . . like you haven’t watched them all come and go,
Snape, hoping you’d be next, thought Harry scathingly.
“Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods
and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you
scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if
all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will
be much more advanced.”
Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a
lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view.
“The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, varied, ever-changing,
and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster,
which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and
cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.”
Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the
Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as
Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?
“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as
flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures”
— he indicated a few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the
Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand toward a witch who was
clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the Dementor’s Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall — “or
provoke the aggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the
ground.
“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil in a highpitched voice. “Is it definite, is he using them?”
“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said Snape, “which
means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them
again. Now . . .”
He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward
his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes
billowing behind him.
“. . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal
spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?”
Hermione’s hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking
around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before
saying curtly, “Very well — Miss Granger?”
“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re
about to perform,” said Hermione, “which gives you a split-second
advantage.”
“An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book
of Spells, Grade Six,” said Snape dismissively (over in the corner,
Malfoy sniggered), “but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress
to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of
surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course;
it is a question of concentration and mind power which some” —
his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more — “lack.”
Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency
lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away.
“You will now divide,” Snape went on, “into pairs. One partner
will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.”
Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half
the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to
perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever
cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of
cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the
incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into
the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville’s muttered JellyLegs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely
have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable
teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He
swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like
an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task.
Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the
face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation
of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting
on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.
“Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. “Here — let me
show you —”
He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, “Protego!”
His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance
and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now
watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.
“Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal
spells, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry stiffly.
“Yes, sir.”
“There’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ Professor.”
The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying.
Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively.
“Detention, Saturday night, my office,” said Snape. “I do not
take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even ‘the Chosen One.’ ”
“That was brilliant, Harry!” chortled Ron, once they were safely
on their way to break a short while later.
“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, frowning at
Ron. “What made you?”
“He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed Harry. “I
had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn’t
he use another guinea pig for a change? What’s Dumbledore playing
at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking
about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructible
stuff —”
“Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit like you.”
“Like me?”
“Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face Voldemort.
You said it wasn’t just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was
just you and your brains and your guts — well, wasn’t that what
Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and
quick-thinking?”
Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well
worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not
argue.
“Harry! Hey, Harry!”
Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last
year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.
“For you,” panted Sloper. “Listen, I heard you’re the new Captain. When’re you holding trials?”
“I’m not sure yet,” said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper
would be very lucky to get back on the team. “I’ll let you know.”
“Oh, right. I was hoping it’d be this weekend —”
But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin,
slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence,
he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment
as he went.
Dear Harry,
I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday.
Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.
Yours sincerely,
Albus Dumbledore
P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.
“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the message over
Harry’s shoulder and was looking perplexed.
“It’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,” said
Harry in a low voice. “Ha! Snape’s not going to be pleased. . . . I
won’t be able to do his detention!”
He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating
on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most
likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death
Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal,
and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach
Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to
Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room,
where they grudgingly started Snape’s homework. This turned out
to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione
joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the
bell rang for the afternoon’s double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long,
been Snape’s.
When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only
a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle
had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four
Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom
Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.
“Harry,” Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry
approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in Defense Against the
Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield
Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are
you, Ron — Hermione?”
Before they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon door
opened and Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of the door. As they
filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his
beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular
enthusiasm.
The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and
odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they
passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table
together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and
Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a
gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive
scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle,
and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the
Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply
and that the potion’s fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink.
A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who
grinned back lazily.
“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, whose massive
outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors.
“Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don’t forget your copies
of Advanced Potion-Making. . . .”
“Sir?” said Harry, raising his hand.
“Harry, m’boy?”
“I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s Ron — we
didn’t realize we’d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see —”
“Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry,
my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the
store cupboard today, and I’m sure we can lend you some scales,
and we’ve got a small stock of old books here, they’ll do until you
can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .”
Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment’s
foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry
and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.
“Now then,” said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class
and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his
waistcoat threatened to burst off, “I’ve prepared a few potions for
you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the
kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your
N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ’em, even if you haven’t
made ’em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?”
He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry
raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain
water boiling away inside it.
Hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s;
Slughorn pointed at her.
“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the
drinker to tell the truth,” said Hermione.
“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this
one here is pretty well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry
leaflets lately too . . . Who can — ?”
Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance
in the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the
credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who
had succeeded in making it, back in their second year.
“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?” said
Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione’s hand
punched the air again.
“It’s Amortentia!”
“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said Slughorn, who
was looking mightily impressed, “but I assume you know what it
does?”
“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said Hermione.
“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive
mother-of-pearl sheen?”
“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione
enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of
us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown
grass and new parchment and —”
But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.
“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione’s embarrassment.
“Hermione Granger, sir.”
“Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector
Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society
of Potioneers?”
“No, I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see.”
Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something;
both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the
contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was
sitting next to her.
“Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in
our year!’ I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke,
Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss
Granger,” said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had
punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant
expression and whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in
the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for
some reason looked annoyed. “You are the best in the year — I’d’ve
told him so if he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could
hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
“Amortentia doesn’t really create love, of course. It is impossible
to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and
powerful potion in this room — oh yes,” he said, nodding gravely
at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically.
“When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. . . .
“And now,” said Slughorn, “it is time for us to start work.”
“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn’s
desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the
color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish
above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.
“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had
not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. “Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a
most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he turned,
smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp,
“that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighten Now all
Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head,
because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided
attention.
“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a
funny little potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately
tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed
correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend
to succeed . . . at least until the effects wear off.”
“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said Terry Boot
eagerly.
“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and
dangerous overconfidence,” said Slughorn. “Too much of a good
thing, you know . . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken
sparingly, and very occasionally . . .”
“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great
interest.
“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was twentyfour, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with
breakfast. Two perfect days.”
He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting
or not, thought Harry, the effect was good.
“And that,” said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, “is
what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.”
There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.
“One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing
it to them all. “Enough for twelve hours’ luck. From dawn till dusk,
you will be lucky in everything you attempt.
“Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance,
examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary
day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!
“So,” said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, “how are you to win my
fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced PotionMaking. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be
time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living
Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here.
Off you go!”
There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward
them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to
their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room
was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through
his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. It could not have been clearer
that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over
the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.
To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled
all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed
portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the
previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out)
Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he
needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting
up valerian roots as fast as he could.
Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was
doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions,
that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the
whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed
to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the
“smooth, black currant-colored liquid” mentioned as the ideal
halfway stage.
Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his
book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher
the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner,
who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the
sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction:
Crush with flat side of silver dagger,
releases juice better than cutting.
“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?”
Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.
“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, “I was sorry to
hear he had died, although of course it wasn’t unexpected, dragon
pox at his age. . . .”
And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry
or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of
the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though
Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle
of Felix Felicis.
The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up.
Harry turned to Hermione.
“Can I borrow your silver knife?”
She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion,
which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to
be turning a light shade of lilac by now.
Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed
the shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into
the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately
turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.
His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot,
Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According to
the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned
clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner had
made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh
counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?
Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once
clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned palest
pink.
“How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who was red-
faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes
from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.
“Add a clockwise stir —”
“No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she snapped.
Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs
counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . .
Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his
potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as
he could see, no one else’s potion had turned as pale as his. He felt
elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this
dungeon.
“And time’s . . . up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, please!”
Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a
stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike
substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over Ernie’s navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw
Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it’s clear you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then,
here you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it
well!”
Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner
pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks
on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on
Hermione’s. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.
“How did you do that?” he whispered to Harry as they left the
dungeon.
“Got lucky, I suppose,” said Harry, because Malfoy was within
earshot.
Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for
dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione’s face
became stonier with every word he uttered.
“I s’pose you think I cheated?” he finished, aggravated by her
expression.
“Well, it wasn’t exactly your own work, was it?” she said stiffly.
“He only followed different instructions to ours,” said Ron.
“Could’ve been a catastrophe, couldn’t it? But he took a risk and it
paid off.” He heaved a sigh. “Slughorn could’ve handed me that
book, but no, I get the one no one’s ever written on. Puked on, by
the look of page fifty-two, but —”
“Hang on,” said a voice close by Harry’s left ear and he caught a
sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn’s
dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them.
“Did I hear right? You’ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?”
She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her
mind at once.
“It’s nothing,” he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. “It’s not
like, you know, Riddle’s diary. It’s just an old textbook someone’s
scribbled on.”
“But you’re doing what it says?”
“I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly,
Ginny, there’s nothing funny —”
“Ginny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at once. “We
ought to check that there’s nothing odd about it. I mean, all these
funny instructions, who knows?”
“Hey!” said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of
Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand.
“Specialis Revelio!” she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover.
Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared.
“Finished?” said Harry irritably. “Or d’you want to wait and see
if it does a few backflips?”
“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. “I mean, it really does seem to be . . . just a textbook.”
“Good. Then I’ll have it back,” said Harry, snatching it off the
table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor.
Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book,
and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of
the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely
hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.
This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.

C H A P T E R T E N
THE HOUSE OF GAUNT

For the rest of the week’s Potions lessons Harry continued to
follow the Half-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth
lesson Slughorn was raving about Harry’s abilities, saying that he
had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione
was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his
book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the
handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to
read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was
resolutely plowing on with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded
poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been.
Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented
him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making,
he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely
a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all
of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up
himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday
evening. “It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks
more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”
“The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,” Harry said. “How many
girls have been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled
and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away
from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of
Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck!
We’ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched
Harry leave through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to
step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared
around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of
dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked.
“Two of spades: conflict,” she murmured, as she passed the place
where Harry crouched, hidden. “Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten
of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly
troubled, one who dislikes the questioner —”
She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry’s statue.
“Well, that can’t be right,” she said, annoyed, and Harry heard
her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but
a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was
quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the
spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood
against the wall.
“Acid Pops,” said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall
behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth
circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore’s office.
Harry knocked.
“Come in,” said Dumbledore’s voice.
“Good evening, sir,” said Harry, walking into the headmaster’s
office.
“Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I hope you’ve had an enjoyable first week back at school?”
“Yes, thanks, sir,” said Harry.
“You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!”
“Er,” began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too
stern.
“I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.”
“Right,” said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind
than Snape’s detention, and now looked around surreptitiously
for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with
him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did;
the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and
headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though
Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.
“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. “You
have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what
prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for
you to be given certain information.”
There was a pause.
“You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me
everything,” said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation
from his voice. “Sir,” he added.
“And so I did,” said Dumbledore placidly. “I told you everything
I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of
memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in,
Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.”
“But you think you’re right?” said Harry.
“Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly
huger.”
“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “does what you’re going to tell me
have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . .
survive?”
“It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next day’s
weather, “and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.”
Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past
Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with
odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in
front of Harry.
“You look worried.”
Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored
and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive,
had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its
contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But
Dumbledore was smiling.
“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more
unusually, with permission.”
“Where are we going, sir?”
“For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said Dumbledore,
pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling
silvery-white substance.
“Who was Bob Ogden?”
“He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” said Dumbledore. “He died some time ago, but not before
I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made
in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry . . .”
But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of
the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful.
“Shall — shall I, sir?”
“No matter, Harry —”
Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew
out.
“Sir — how did you injure your hand?” Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity.
“Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have
an appointment with Bob Ogden.”
Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the
Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas.
“After you,” said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl.
Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face
into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he
was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had
adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.
They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled
hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forgetme-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man
wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike
specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of
the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this
must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also
wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock
coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before
Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance,
however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.
Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden
sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the
way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm
pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile.
They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows,
the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure
ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping
steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view
of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep
hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set
on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded
by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.
Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried
to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found
Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He
soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were
going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and
when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden’s frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.
Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track
bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left
behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark
trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up
at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind
Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.
Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool
shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry’s eyes discerned the
building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him
a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision
to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of
the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls
were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters
were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching
the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had
concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of
the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of
steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking.
Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather
cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he
stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had
nailed a dead snake.
Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped
from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden,
who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat
and stumbled.
“You’re not welcome.”
The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with
dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing.
His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He
might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several
more paces before he spoke.
“Er — good morning. I’m from the Ministry of Magic —”
“You’re not welcome.”
“Er — I’m sorry — I don’t understand you,” said Ogden
nervously.
Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger
was making himself very clear in Harry’s opinion, particularly as he
was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody
knife in the other.
“You understand him, I’m sure, Harry?” said Dumbledore quietly.
“Yes, of course,” said Harry, slightly nonplussed. “Why can’t
Ogden — ?”
But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood.
“He’s speaking Parseltongue?”
“Very good,” said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling.
The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one
hand, wand in the other.
“Now, look —” Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang,
and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty
yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.
“Morfin!” said a loud voice.
An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging
the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically.
This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his
shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his
bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him
the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the
man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the
sight of Ogden on the ground.
“Ministry, is it?” said the older man, looking down at Ogden.
“Correct!” said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. “And you, I take
it, are Mr. Gaunt?”
“S’right,” said Gaunt. “Got you in the face, did he?”
“Yes, he did!” snapped Ogden.
“Should’ve made your presence known, shouldn’t you?” said
Gaunt aggressively. “This is private property. Can’t just walk in
here and not expect my son to defend himself.”
“Defend himself against what, man?” said Ogden, clambering
back to his feet.
“Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.”
Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing
large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped
at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin.
“Get in the house. Don’t argue.”
This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even
while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished
the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin
seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast
him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to
the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door
behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again.
“It’s your son I’m here to see, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, as he
mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. “That was
Morfin, wasn’t it?”
“Ar, that was Morfin,” said the old man indifferently. “Are you
pure-blood?” he asked, suddenly aggressive.
“That’s neither here nor there,” said Ogden coldly, and Harry
felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather
differently. He squinted into Ogden’s face and muttered, in what
was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, “Now I come to think
about it, I’ve seen noses like yours down in the village.”
“I don’t doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,” said Ogden. “Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?”
“Inside?”
“Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I’ve already told you. I’m here about Morfin.
We sent an owl —”
“I’ve no use for owls,” said Gaunt. “I don’t open letters.”
“Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,” said Ogden tartly. “I am here following a serious breach of
Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this
morning —”
“All right, all right, all right!” bellowed Gaunt. “Come in the
bleeding house, then, and much good it’ll do you!”
The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led
off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking
fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning
softly at it in Parseltongue:
Hissy, hissy, little snakey,
Slither on the floor,
You be good to Morfin
Or he’ll nail you to the door.
There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room,
a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone
wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy
black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalidlooking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she
had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother’s,
stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the
two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeatedlooking person.
“M’daughter, Merope,” said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked
inquiringly toward her.
“Good morning,” said Ogden.
She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father
turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on
the shelf behind her.
“Well, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, “to get straight to the point, we
have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in
front of a Muggle late last night.”
There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the
pots.
“Pick it up!” Gaunt bellowed at her. “That’s it, grub on the floor
like some filthy Muggle, what’s your wand for, you useless sack of
muck?”
“Mr. Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope,
who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost
her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket,
pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that
caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.
Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed,
“Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!”
Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to
raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, “Reparo.”
The pot mended itself instantly.
Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at
Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his
daughter, “Lucky the nice man from the Ministry’s here, isn’t it?
Perhaps he’ll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn’t mind dirty
Squibs. . . .”
Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope
picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She
then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy
window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than
to sink into the stone and vanish.
“Mr. Gaunt,” Ogden began again, “as I’ve said: the reason for
my visit —”
“I heard you the first time!” snapped Gaunt. “And so what?
Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him — what
about it, then?”
“Morfin has broken Wizarding law,” said Ogden sternly.
“ ‘Morfin has broken Wizarding law.’ ” Gaunt imitated Ogden’s
voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again.
“He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that’s illegal now, is it?”
“Yes,” said Ogden. “I’m afraid it is.”
He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and
unrolled it.
“What’s that, then, his sentence?” said Gaunt, his voice rising
angrily.
“It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing —”
“Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning
my son anywhere?”
“I’m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,” said Ogden.
“And you think we’re scum, do you?” screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his
chest. “Scum who’ll come running when the Ministry tells ’em to?
Do you know who you’re talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do
you?
“I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,”
said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground.
“That’s right!” roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought
Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that
he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing
on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden’s eyes. “See this? See
this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it’s
been in our family, that’s how far back we go, and pure-blood all
the way! Know how much I’ve been offered for this, with the
Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?”
“I’ve really no idea,” said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed
within an inch of his nose, “and it’s quite beside the point, Mr.
Gaunt. Your son has committed —”
With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split
second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew
to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by
a gold chain around her neck.
“See this?” he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at
him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath.
“I see it, I see it!” said Ogden hastily.
“Slytherin’s!” yelled Gaunt. “Salazar Slytherin’s! We’re his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?”
“Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!” said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt
had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to
her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air.
“So!” said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a
complicated point beyond all possible dispute. “Don’t you go talking to us as if we’re dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods,
wizards all — more than you can say, I don’t doubt!”
And he spat on the floor at Ogden’s feet. Morfin cackled again.
Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face
hidden by her lank hair, said nothing.
“Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden doggedly, “I am afraid that neither
your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in
hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information” — he glanced down at his
scroll of parchment — “is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on
the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.”
Morfin giggled.
“Be quiet, boy,” snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell
silent again.
“And so what if he did, then?” Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden. “I
expect you’ve wiped the Muggle’s filthy face clean for him, and his
memory to boot —”
“That’s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?” said Ogden. “This
was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless —”
“Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw
you,” sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again.
“This discussion is getting us nowhere,” said Ogden firmly. “It is
clear from your son’s attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.” He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. “Morfin
will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the
charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and
distress to that same Mugg —”
Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and
loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window.
Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the
copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide.
Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was
starkly white.
“My God, what an eyesore!” rang out a girl’s voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. “Couldn’t your father have that hovel cleared away,
Tom?”
“It’s not ours,” said a young man’s voice. “Everything on the
other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an
old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son’s quite mad, you
should hear some of the stories they tell in the village —”
The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing
louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair.
“Keep your seat,” said his father warningly, in Parseltongue.
“Tom,” said the girl’s voice again, now so close they were clearly
right beside the house, “I might be wrong — but has somebody
nailed a snake to that door?”
“Good lord, you’re right!” said the man’s voice. “That’ll be the
son, I told you he’s not right in the head. Don’t look at it, Cecilia,
darling.”
The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter
again.
“ ‘Darling,’ ” whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his
sister. “ ‘Darling,’ he called her. So he wouldn’t have you anyway.”
Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint.
“What’s that?” said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking
from his son to his daughter. “What did you say, Morfin?”
“She likes looking at that Muggle,” said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified.
“Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at
him, isn’t she? And last night —”
Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on
ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home,
wasn’t she?”
“Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said Gaunt
quietly.
All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who
was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak
of incomprehensible hissing and rasping.
“Is it true?” said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two
toward the terrified girl. “My daughter — pure-blooded descendant
of Salazar Slytherin — hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?”
Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall,
apparently unable to speak.
“But I got him, Father!” cackled Morfin. “I got him as he went by
and he didn’t look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?”
“You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!” roared
Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter’s
throat.
Both Harry and Ogden yelled “No!” at the same time; Ogden
raised his wand and cried, “Relashio!” Gaunt was thrown backward,
away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his
back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at
Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand.
Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to
follow and Harry obeyed, Merope’s screams echoing in his ears.
Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his
arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut
horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he
and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with
laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse’s flank
and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in
dust, running pell-mell up the lane.
“I think that will do, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He took Harry
by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring
weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their
feet, back in Dumbledore’s now twilit office.
“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said Harry at once,
as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. “Merope, or
whatever her name was?”
“Oh, she survived,” said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind
his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. “Ogden
Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements
within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight,
but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a
record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban.
Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition
to Ogden, received six months.”
“Marvolo?” Harry repeated wonderingly.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. “I am glad
to see you’re keeping up.”
“That old man was — ?”
“Voldemort’s grandfather, yes,” said Dumbledore. “Marvolo, his
son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the
Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to
their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled
with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was
squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as
you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper,
a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family
heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more
than his daughter.”
“So Merope,” said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, “so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she
was . . . Voldemort’s mother?”
“It does,” said Dumbledore. “And it so happens that we also had
a glimpse of Voldemort’s father. I wonder whether you noticed?”
“The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?”
“Very good indeed,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Yes, that was
Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding
past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a
secret, burning passion.”
“And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, unable to
imagine two people less likely to fall in love.
“I think you are forgetting,” said Dumbledore, “that Merope
was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to
their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father.
Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was
alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was
able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the
desperate life she had led for eighteen years.
“Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to
make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love
with her instead?”
“The Imperius Curse?” Harry suggested. “Or a love potion?”
“Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a
love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her,
and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day,
when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of
water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just
witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous
scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire’s son
ran off with the tramp’s daughter, Merope.
“But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s. He returned
from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his
return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear
inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.
“From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned
her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he
had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly
weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the
cottage.”
“And Merope? She . . . she died, didn’t she? Wasn’t Voldemort
brought up in an orphanage?”
“Yes, indeed,” said Dumbledore. “We must do a certain amount
of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce
what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway
marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little
Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’
What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use
those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they
heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that
Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to
have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.”
“But she did have his baby.”
“But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left
her while she was still pregnant.”
“What went wrong?” asked Harry. “Why did the love potion
stop working?”
“Again, this is guesswork,” said Dumbledore, “but I believe that
Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear
to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she
made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted
as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have
fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay
for the baby’s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her,
never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of
his son.”
The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore’s
office seemed to glow more brightly than before.
“I think that will do for tonight, Harry,” said Dumbledore after
a moment or two.
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
He got to his feet, but did not leave.
“Sir . . . is it important to know all this about Voldemort’s past?”
“Very important, I think,” said Dumbledore.
“And it . . . it’s got something to do with the prophecy?”
“It has everything to do with the prophecy.”
“Right,” said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same.
He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he
turned back again. “Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione
everything you’ve told me?”
Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, “Yes, I
think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat
any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got
around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort’s
secrets.”
“No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione. Good
night.”
He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw
it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported
so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set
with a large, cracked, black stone.
“Sir,” said Harry, staring at it. “That ring —”
“Yes?” said Dumbledore.
“You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that
night.”
“So I was,” Dumbledore agreed.
“But isn’t it . . . sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed
Ogden?”
Dumbledore bowed his head. “The very same.”
“But how come — ? Have you always had it?”
“No, I acquired it very recently,” said Dumbledore. “A few days
before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle’s, in fact.”
“That would be around the time you injured your hand, then,
sir?”
“Around that time, yes, Harry.”
Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling.
“Sir, how exactly — ?”
“Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good
night.”
“Good night, sir.”

C H A P T E R E L E V E N
HERMIONE’S HELPING HAND

As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years’ free periods
were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast
amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they
studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely
understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these
days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once
or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment,
Harry’s best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the
Half-Blood Prince.
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense
Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too.
Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common
room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining
as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they
were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they
were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology,
but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous
Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.
One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of
practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione
had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had
stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on
the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out
in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear
their greetings.
“We’ve got to go and explain,” said Hermione, looking up at
Hagrid’s huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday
at breakfast.
“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron. “And
we’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from
Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we
hated his stupid subject?”
“We didn’t hate it!” said Hermione.
“Speak for yourself, I haven’t forgotten the skrewts,” said Ron
darkly. “And I’m telling you now, we’ve had a narrow escape. You
didn’t hear him going on about his gormless brother — we’d have
been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.”
“I hate not talking to Hagrid,” said Hermione, looking upset.
“We’ll go down after Quidditch,” Harry assured her. He too was
missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives. “But trials might take all
morning, the number of people who have applied.” He felt slightly
nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. “I dunno
why the team’s this popular all of a sudden.”
“Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It’s
not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you! You’ve never been more interesting, and frankly, you’ve never been more fanciable.”
Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one
look of disdain before turning back to Harry.
*Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, don’t they?
The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right
about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him
twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they’re
calling you ‘the Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t you see why
people are fascinated by you?”
Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even
though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.
“And you’ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry
when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar.
You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil
woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to
your story anyway. . . .”
“You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,” said Ron, shaking back his sleeves.
“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the
summer either,” Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.
“I’m tall,” said Ron inconsequentially.
The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked
windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people
were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to
hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was
well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term;
his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had
hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white
Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed
in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later,
an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his
minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon.
“Ha!” said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of
Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts.
“Oh good,” said Hermione, delighted. “Now you can give that
graffitied copy back.”
“Are you mad?” said Harry. “I’m keeping it! Look, I’ve thought
it out —”
He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his
bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, “Diffindo!”
The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book
(Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers,
tapped each, and said, “Reparo!”
There sat the Prince’s copy, disguised as a new book, and there
sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly
secondhand.
“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can’t complain, it cost
nine Galleons.”
Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her
carrying that day’s copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it
hastily and scanned the front page.
“Anyone we know dead?” asked Ron in a determinedly casual
voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened
her paper.
“No, but there have been more dementor attacks,” said Hermione. “And an arrest.”
“Excellent, who?” said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange.
“Stan Shunpike,” said Hermione.
“What?” said Harry, startled.
“ ‘Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater
activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after
a raid on his Clapham home . . .’ ”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the
spotty youth he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron
reasonably. “You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It
says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the
Death Eaters’ secret plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled
expression on her face. “If he was under the Imperius Curse, he’d
hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?”
“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he
did,” said Ron. “Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?”
“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re playing at,
taking Stan seriously.”
“They probably want to look as though they’re doing something,” said Hermione, frowning. “People are terrified — you know
the Patil twins’ parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen
has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.”
“What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “But Hogwarts is
safer than their homes, bound to be! We’ve got Aurors, and all
those extra protective spells, and we’ve got Dumbledore!”
“I don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said Hermione very
quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet.
“Haven’t you noticed? His seat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s
this past week.”
Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster’s
chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not
seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.
“I think he’s left the school to do something with the Order,”
said Hermione in a low voice. “I mean . . . it’s all looking serious,
isn’t it?
Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were
all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the
day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen
Hannah since.
When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head
down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and
Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the
Patil twins’ parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was
unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when
Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who
looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then
returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became some-
thing more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had
broken Harry’s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant
all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle,
and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron
good luck.
As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning.
Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first
years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old
school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking
coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy
Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.
“We met on the train, in old Sluggy’s compartment,” he said
confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry’s hand.
“Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.”
“You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked Harry, taking note
of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably
block all three goal hoops without even moving.
“I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,” said
McLaggen, with something of a swagger. “Ate a pound of doxy eggs
for a bet.”
“Right,” said Harry. “Well . . . if you wait over there . . .”
He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over
McLaggen’s face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both “old Sluggy’s” favorites.
Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for
the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch.
This was a good decision: The first ten was made up of first years
and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown
before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a
few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one
of the goal posts.
The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry
had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell
about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was
amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so
quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone
else.
The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of
the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group
were Hufflepuffs.
“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from Gryffindor,” roared
Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, “leave now,
please!”
There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went
sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.
After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry
had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team
after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was
particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who
had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to
boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also
shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.
“That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of the way for
the Keepers I’ll hex you,” he bellowed.
Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and
George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy
Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed
to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry’s head with
a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy
but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in
the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.
Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last,
hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned.
Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of
people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had
joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each
Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in
equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a
problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final
match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was
a delicate shade of green.
None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals
apiece. To Harry’s great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved
four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in
completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and
McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.
Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep
Eleven. “Good luck!” cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked
around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown.
He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as
she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought
to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.
Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four,
five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the
cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to
tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to
find McLaggen’s red face inches from his own. He stepped back
hastily.
“His sister didn’t really try,” said McLaggen menacingly. There
was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernon’s. “She gave him an easy save.”
“Rubbish,” said Harry coldly. “That was the one he nearly
missed.”
McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this
time.
“Give me another go.”
“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. Ron
saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my
way.”
He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him,
but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away,
growling what sounded like threats to thin air.
Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.
“Well done,” he croaked. “You flew really well —”
“You did brilliantly, Ron!”
This time it really was Hermione running toward them from
the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm
with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked
extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he
grinned at the team and at Hermione.
After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following
Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of
the team and headed off toward Hagrid’s. A watery sun was trying
to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at
last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagrid’s.
“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” Ron was saying happily. “Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of
spin on it —”
“Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, looking amused.
“I was better than that McLaggen anyway,” said Ron in a highly
satisfied voice. “Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like he’d been Confunded. . . .”
To Harry’s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink
at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing
each of his other penalties in loving detail.
The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of
Hagrid’s cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach
and turned his huge head toward them.
“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit scary, isn’t
he?”
“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron.
Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without
breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak
sank into a bow too.
“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head. “Missing him? But you’re okay
here with Hagrid, aren’t you?”
“Oi!” said a loud voice.
Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin
wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His
enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming
bark and bounded forward.
“Git away from him! He’ll have yer fingers — oh. It’s yeh lot.”
Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick
their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second,
then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind
him.
“Oh dear!” said Hermione, looking stricken.
“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly. He walked over to the
door and knocked loudly.
“Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!”
There was no sound from within.
“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry said,
pulling out his wand.
“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t possibly —”
“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back —”
But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again
as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering
down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively
alarming.
“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! How dare
yeh threaten ter break down my door!”
“I’m sorry, sir,” said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he
stowed his wand inside his robes.
Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?”
“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?”
“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. That’s me
outsmarted, innit? All righ’, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .”
Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione
scurried in after Harry, looking rather frightened.
“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry’s knee and drooling all over his robes.
“What’s this? Feelin’ sorry for me? Reckon I’m lonely or summat?”
“No,” said Harry at once. “We wanted to see you.”
“We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously.
“Missed me, have yeh?” snorted Hagrid. “Yeah. Righ’.”
He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper
kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three
bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a
plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid’s
cooking, and took one at once.
“Hagrid,” said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the
table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.”
Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they
were not staying for dinner.
“We did!” said Hermione. “But none of us could fit it into our
schedules!”
“Yeah. Righ’,” said Hagrid again.
There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around:
Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and
hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the
corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked
like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing.
“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the
same.
“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.
“And they grow into . . . ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.
“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em ter feed
ter Aragog.”
And without warning, he burst into tears.
“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the
table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an
arm around his shaking shoulders. “What is it?”
“It’s . . . him . . .” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. “It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I
think he’s dyin’. . . . He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’
better. . . . I don’ know what I’ll do if he . . . if he . . . We’ve bin
tergether so long. . . .”
Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss
for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him
croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to
reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps
the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic
talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years
previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting
to stem the flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s
family . . . they’re gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill . . . bit restive . . .”
“Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said Ron in an
undertone.
“. . . I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the
colony at the mo’,” Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his
apron and looking up. “But thanks fer offerin’, Hermione. . . . It
means a lot. . . .”
After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although
neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed
giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to
take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.
“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer
timetables,” he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. “Even if yeh
applied fer Time-Turners —”
“We couldn’t have done,” said Hermione. “We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet.”
“Ar, well then,” said Hagrid. “There’s no way yeh could’ve done
it. . . . I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh know — I’ve jus’ bin worried abou’
Aragog . . . an’ I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank
had bin teachin’ yeh —”
At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully
that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a
few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time
Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite
cheerful.
“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed behind
them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted
grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. “And I’ve got that detention
with Snape tonight, I haven’t got much time for dinner. . . .”
As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the
doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely
guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but
Harry caught Hermione’s arm and held her back.
“What?” said Hermione defensively.
“If you ask me,” said Harry quietly, “McLaggen looks like he
was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front
of where you were sitting.”
Hermione blushed.
“Oh, all right then, I did it,” she whispered. “But you should
have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, he’s got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he
didn’t get in — you wouldn’t have wanted someone like that on
the team.”
“No,” said Harry. “No, I suppose that’s true. But wasn’t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you’re a prefect, aren’t you?”
“Oh, be quiet,” she snapped, as he smirked.
“What are you two doing?” demanded Ron, reappearing in the
doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious.
“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried
after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry’s stomach ache with
hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor 
table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them,
blocking their path.
“Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!” he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out
his enormous belly. “I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What
do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We’re
having a little party, just a few rising stars, I’ve got McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin — I don’t know
whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries — and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will
favor me by coming too.”
Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It
was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as
look at him.
“I can’t come, Professor,” said Harry at once. “I’ve got a detention with Professor Snape.”
“Oh dear!” said Slughorn, his face falling comically. “Dear, dear, I
was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I’ll just have to have a word
with Severus and explain the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later!”
He bustled away out of the Hall.
“He’s got no chance of persuading Snape,” said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. “This detention’s already been
postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it
for anyone else.”
“Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!”
said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about
McLaggen.
“I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,” snapped
Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by
Slughorn.
After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The
common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down;
Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with
Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione
reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody
had left abandoned on a chair.
“Anything new?” said Harry.
“Not really . . .” Hermione had opened the newspaper and was
scanning the inside pages. “Oh, look, your dad’s in here, Ron —
he’s all right!” she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in
alarm. “It just says he’s been to visit the Malfoys’ house. ‘This second search of the Death Eater’s residence does not seem to have yielded
any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that
his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off.’ ”
“Yeah, mine!” said Harry. “I told him at King’s Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it’s not
at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts
with him —”
“But how can he have done, Harry?” said Hermione, putting
down the newspaper with a surprised look. “We were all searched
when we arrived, weren’t we?”
“Were you?” said Harry, taken aback. “I wasn’t!”
“Oh no, of course you weren’t, I forgot you were late. . . . Well,
Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the
entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for
a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy
can’t have brought in anything dangerous!”
Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing
with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around
this objection.
“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said. “His mother or
someone.”
“All the owls are being checked too,” said Hermione. “Filch told
us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he
could reach.”
Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say.
There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a
dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at
Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender
Brown.
“Can you think of any way Malfoy — ?”
“Oh, drop it, Harry,” said Ron.
“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to
his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!” said Harry,
firing up.
“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said Ron, getting to his
feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.”
He stomped off toward the door to the boys’ dormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring after him.
“Harry?” said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. “I’ve got a message for you.”
“From Professor Slughorn?” asked Harry, sitting up hopefully.
“No . . . from Professor Snape,” said Demelza. Harry’s heart
sank. “He says you’re to come to his office at half past eight tonight
to do your detention — er — no matter how many party invitations you’ve received. And he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting
out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and —
and he says there’s no need to bring protective gloves.”
“Right,” said Harry grimly. “Thanks a lot, Demelza.”

SILVER AND OPAL S

Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry
caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next
few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was
sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school
for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was
supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons
were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt
bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.
Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to
Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still
be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around
the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it
was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.
Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving
stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his
copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed
reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was
indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that
way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more
Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in
there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were
earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the
imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which
Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the
Prince had invented himself.
Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince’s self-invented
spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the
mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato,
a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable
buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. The only person who did not find these
charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry
had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that
seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many
crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of
the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows,
and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets.
Nvbl . . . that had to mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he
would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having
difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick
to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the
Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward
flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head.
“Aaaaaaaargh!”
There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced
Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in
midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the
ankle.
“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter,
and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of
bed. “Hang on — I’ll let you down —”
He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic,
trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered
one cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the
counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might.
There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his
mattress.
“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.
“Tomorrow,” said Ron in a muffled voice, “I’d rather you set the
alarm clock.”
By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with
several of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying
cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron’s shock had subsided and he had
decided that Harry’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in
fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as
they sat down for breakfast.
“. . . and then there was another flash of light and I landed on
the bed again!” Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages.
Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and
now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.
“Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion
book of yours?” she asked.
Harry frowned at her.
“Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?”
“Was it?”
“Well . . . yeah, it was, but so what?”
“So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?”
“Why does it matter if it’s handwritten?” said Harry, preferring
not to answer the rest of the question.
“Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic–approved,” said
Hermione. “And also,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their
eyes, “because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit
dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his
sausages. “Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like
that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing.
And, er —”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use
the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about
that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince
possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s
not the only one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case
you’ve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float
along, asleep, helpless.”
Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered
the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron
came to his aid.
“That was different,” he said robustly. “They were abusing it.
Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don’t like the
Prince, Hermione,” he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly,
“because he’s better than you at Potions —”
“It’s got nothing to do with that!” said Hermione, her cheeks
reddening. “I just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing
spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking
about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname,
and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!”
“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly. “If
he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting
about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?”
Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been
pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would
worry about that later. . . .
“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough
pure-blood wizards left,” said Hermione stubbornly. “I expect most
of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggleborns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.”
“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. “My
whole family are blood traitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to
Death Eaters!”
“And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically. “We’d be
best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me in.”
This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile,
and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.
“Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this.”
It was a scroll of parchment with Harry’s name written upon it
in familiar thin, slanting writing.
“Thanks, Ginny . . . It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” Harry told
Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents. “Monday evening!” He felt suddenly light and
happy. “Want to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?” he asked.
“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she replied, waving at them as she left.
Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off
the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade.
The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triplechecking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.
“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?” demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. “Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?”
His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he
was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.
The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped
his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw
and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double
against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether
they might not have had a better time in the warm common room,
and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s
Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation
that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a
thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully
open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the
crowded shop.
“Thank God,” shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm,
toffee-scented air. “Let’s stay here all afternoon.”
“Harry, m’boy!” said a booming voice from behind them.
“Oh no,” muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an
overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop.
“Harry, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now!” said
Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. “It won’t do, m’boy,
I’m determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don’t you?”
“Yes,” said Hermione helplessly, “they’re really —”
“So why don’t you come along, Harry?” demanded Slughorn.
“Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,” said Harry, who
had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent
him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant
that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny,
imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.
“Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this
hard work!” said Slughorn. “But a little recreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about Monday night, you can’t possibly want to
practice in this weather. . . .”
“I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening.”
“Unlucky again!” cried Slughorn dramatically. “Ah, well . . . you
can’t evade me forever, Harry!”
And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach
Clusters.
“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said Hermione, shaking her head. “They’re not that bad, you know. . . . They’re
even quite fun sometimes. . . .” But then she caught sight of Ron’s
expression. “Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those
would last hours!”
Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed
much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he
would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and
merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to
go next.
“Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks,” said Harry. “It’ll be warm.”
They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the
sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the
sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; no-

 245 
body was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations.
The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just
outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman
who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head. As
Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak
more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter
man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet
from him when Harry realized who the man was.
“Mundungus!”
The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair
jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.
“Oh, ’ello, ’Arry,” said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. “Well, don’t let me keep ya.”
And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents
of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.
“Are you selling this stuff?” asked Harry, watching Mundungus
grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground.
“Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,” said Mundungus. “Gimme
that!”
Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.
“Hang on,” Ron said slowly. “This looks familiar —”
“Thank you!” said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of
Ron’s hand and stuffing it back into the case. “Well, I’ll see you
all — OUCH!”
Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by
the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his
wand.

 246 
“Harry!” squealed Hermione.
“You took that from Sirius’s house,” said Harry, who was almost
nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant
smell of old tobacco and spirits. “That had the Black family crest
on it.”
“I — no — what — ?” spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly
turning purple.
“What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the
place?” snarled Harry.
“I — no —”
“Give it to me!”
“Harry, you mustn’t!” shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus
started to turn blue.
There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus’s
throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case,
then — CRACK — he Disapparated.
Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see
where Mundungus had gone.
“COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — !”
“There’s no point, Harry.”
Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with
sleet.
“Mundungus will probably be in London by now. There’s no
point yelling.”
“He’s nicked Sirius’s stuff! Nicked it!”
“Yes, but still,” said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by
this piece of information. “You should get out of the cold.”
She watched them go through the door of the Three Broomsticks.

 247 
The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, “He was nicking
Sirius’s stuff !”
“I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are staring,” whispered Hermione. “Go and sit down, I’ll get you a drink.”
Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a
few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.
“Can’t the Order control Mundungus?” Harry demanded of the
other two in a furious whisper. “Can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?”
“Shh!” said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure
nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close
by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was
lolling against a pillar not far away. “Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I
know it’s your things he’s stealing —”
Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten
that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
“Yeah, it’s my stuff!” he said. “No wonder he wasn’t pleased to
see me! Well, I’m going to tell Dumbledore what’s going on, he’s
the only one who scares Mundungus.”
“Good idea,” whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry
was calming down. “Ron, what are you staring at?”
“Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry
knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.
“I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more firewhisky,” said
Hermione waspishly.
Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently
considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione

 248 
drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron
and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said, “Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?”
The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the
weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they
drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves,
pulled on their gloves, then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of
the pub and back up the High Street. Harry’s thoughts strayed to
Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen
slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry,
because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoot’s
Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his
head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.
It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of
Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on
the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their
indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about
something Katie was holding in her hand. “It’s nothing to do with
you, Leanne!” Harry heard Katie say.
They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast,
blurring Harry’s glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe
them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding;
Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground.
At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended
comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as
though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce
wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of

 249 
expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in
their tracks, watching.
Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream.
Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was
feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and
screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katie’s ankles,
trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, she
fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she
was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognize any of them.
Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.
“Stay there!” he shouted at the others over the howling wind.
“I’m going for help!”
He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone
behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had
caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with
what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.
“Hagrid!” he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow
into which he had fallen.
“Harry!” said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and
beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. “Jus’ bin
visitin’ Grawp, he’s comin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ —”
“Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or something —”
“Wha?” said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind.
“Someone’s been cursed!” bellowed Harry.

 25 
“Cursed? Who’s bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione?”
“No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way . . .”
Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to
find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing
and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were
all trying to quiet her.
“Get back!” shouted Hagrid. “Lemme see her!”
“Something’s happened to her!” sobbed Leanne. “I don’t know
what —”
Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent
down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with
her. Within seconds, Katie’s piercing screams had died away and
the only sound was the roar of the wind.
Hermione hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and put an arm
around her.
“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?”
The girl nodded.
“Did it just happen all of a sudden, or — ?”
“It was when that package tore,” sobbed Leanne, pointing at the
now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split
open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back.
“Don’t touch it!”
He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking
out of the paper.
“I’ve seen that before,” said Harry, staring at the thing. “It was
on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was
cursed. Katie must have touched it.” He looked up at Leanne, who

 251 
had started to shake uncontrollably. “How did Katie get hold of
this?”
“Well, that’s why we were arguing. She came back from the
bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She
looked all funny when she said it. . . . Oh no, oh no, I bet she’d
been Imperiused and I didn’t realize!”
Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder
gently.
“She didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne?”
“No . . . she wouldn’t tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid
and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn’t listen and . . .
and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and — and —”
Leanne let out a wail of despair.
“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her arm still
around Leanne. “We’ll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . .”
Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around
his face and, ignoring Ron’s gasp, carefully covered the necklace in
it and picked it up.
“We’ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,” he said.
As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was
thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he
spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer.
“Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and
Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was
hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day
when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!”
“I — I dunno, Harry,” said Ron hesitantly. “Loads of people go

 252 
to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the
girls’ bathroom?”
“She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn’t
necessarily get it in the bathroom itself —”
“McGonagall!” said Ron warningly.
Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.
“Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell —
upstairs to my office at once, please! What’s that you’re holding,
Potter?”
“It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry.
“Good lord,” said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she
took the necklace from Harry. “No, no, Filch, they’re with me!” she
added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance
hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. “Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in
the scarf!”
Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs
and into her office. The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in
their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in
the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around
her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing
Leanne.
“Well?” she said sharply. “What happened?”
Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control
her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone
to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding
the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and

 253 
how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver
unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the
parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome,
there was no getting another word out of her.
“All right,” said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, “go up to
the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give
you something for shock.”
When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back
to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?”
“She rose up in the air,” said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione could speak, “and then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?”
“The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,” said Professor
McGonagall, looking surprised.
“Away?” Harry repeated angrily.
“Yes, Potter, away!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. “But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to
me, I’m sure!”
For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did
not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more
intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however
wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to
worry about being laughed at.
“I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.”
On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite
keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.

 254 
“That is a very serious accusation, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. “Do you have any proof?”
“No,” said Harry, “but . . .” and he told her about following
Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mr. Borgin.
When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked
slightly confused.
“Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?”
“No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend
something, he didn’t have it with him. But that’s not the point, the
thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it
was that necklace —”
“You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?”
“No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him —”
“But Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Borgin asked him if he
wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no —”
“Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said Harry
angrily.
“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look carrying that
down the street?’ ” said Hermione.
“Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,” interjected Ron.
“Oh, Ron,” said Hermione despairingly, “it would be all
wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide
inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved
at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew
would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and
in any case,” she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt,
“I asked Borgin about the necklace, don’t you remember? When I

 255 
went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I
saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say it was
already sold or anything —”
“Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were
up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn’t going to tell
you — anyway, Malfoy could’ve sent off for it since —”
“That’s enough!” said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione
opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. “Potter, I appreciate
you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr.
Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace
might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds
of people —”
“— that’s what I said —” muttered Ron.
“— and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in
place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge —”
“But —”
“— and what is more,” said Professor McGonagall, with an air
of awful finality, “Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.”
Harry gaped at her, deflating.
“How do you know, Professor?”
“Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to
complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank
you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,” she said as she marched
past them, “but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check
on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.”
She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file
past her without another word.
Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall;

 256 
nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.
“So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace
to?” asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room.
“Goodness only knows,” said Hermione. “But whoever it was
has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package
without touching the necklace.”
“It could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said Harry. “Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must
be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons
Voldemort really wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s
sided with Dumbledore. Or —”
“Or you,” said Hermione, looking troubled.
“Couldn’t have been,” said Harry, “or Katie would’ve just turned
around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn’t she? I was behind
her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made
much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with
Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?”
“Harry, Malfoy wasn’t in Hogsmeade!” said Hermione, actually
stamping her foot in frustration.
“He must have used an accomplice, then,” said Harry. “Crabbe
or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he’ll have
loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up —”
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There’s no
point arguing with him.
“Dilligrout,” said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady.
The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room.
It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people

 257 
seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad
weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however:
Clearly, the news of Katie’s fate had not yet spread.
“It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think
about it,” said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the
good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. “The curse
didn’t even make it into the castle. Not what you’d call foolproof.”
“You’re right,” said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair
with her foot and offering it to the first year again. “It wasn’t very
well thought-out at all.”
“But since when has Malfoy been one of the world’s great
thinkers?” asked Harry.
Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him.

C H A P T E R T H I R T E E N
THE SECRET RIDDLE

Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical
Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the
news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school,
though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry,
Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself
had not been the intended target.
“Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,” said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his 
Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.
Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from
wherever he had been in time for Monday night’s lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside
Dumbledore’s office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his hand was as
black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry
to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling.
“You have had a busy time while I have been away,” Dumbledore said. “I believe you witnessed Katie’s accident.”
“Yes, sir. How is she?”
“Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears
to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of
skin: There was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she
even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps
instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent
a rapid spread of the curse —”
“Why him?” asked Harry quickly. “Why not Madam Pomfrey?”
“Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the
wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-grandfather,
raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping.
“I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day.”
“Yes, thank you, Phineas,” said Dumbledore quellingly. “Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam
Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungo’s staff are sending me
hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.”
“Where were you this weekend, sir?” Harry asked, disregarding
a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly.
“I would rather not say just now,” said Dumbledore. “However,
I shall tell you in due course.”
“You will?” said Harry, startled.
“Yes, I expect so,” said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle
of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a
prod of his wand.
“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.”
“Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating
your inheritance with light-fingered contempt,” said Dumbledore,
frowning a little. “He has gone to ground since you accosted him
outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me.
However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any
more of Sirius’s old possessions.”
“That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?”
said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame,
undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld
Place.
“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did Professor
McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About
Draco Malfoy?”
“She told me of your suspicions, yes,” said Dumbledore.
“And do you — ?”
“I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who
might have had a hand in Katie’s accident,” said Dumbledore. “But
what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.”
Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very
important, why had there been such a long gap between the first
and second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but
watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his
long-fingered hands.
“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord
Voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle,
Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned
to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in
London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord
Voldemort.”
“How do you know she was in London, sir?”
“Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,” said Dumbledore, “who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop
whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.”
He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him
swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out
of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in
the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch
of hair that completely covered his eyes.
“Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in
by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now.
She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious.
Covered in rags and pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see.
She said the locket had been Slytherin’s. Well, we hear that sort of
story all the time, ‘Oh, this was Merlin’s, this was, his favorite
teapot,’ but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few
simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that
made it near enough priceless. She didn’t seem to have any idea
how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!”
Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory
from whence he had come.
“He only gave her ten Galleons?” said Harry indignantly.
“Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,” said Dumbledore. “So we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope
was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate
enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that
was one of Marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms.”
“But she could do magic!” said Harry impatiently. “She could
have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn’t she?”
“Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is my
belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right — that
when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I
do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course,
it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair
sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are
about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her
own life.”
“She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?”
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “Could you possibly be feeling
sorry for Lord Voldemort?”
“No,” said Harry quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t she, not
like my mother —”
“Your mother had a choice too,” said Dumbledore gently. “Yes,
Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but
do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by
long suffering and she never had your mother’s courage. And now,
if you will stand . . .”
“Where are we going?” Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him
at the front of the desk.
“This time,” said Dumbledore, “we are going to enter my
memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly
accurate. After you, Harry . . .”
Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of
the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . .
Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and
found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, oldfashioned London street.
“There I am,” said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of
them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn
milk cart.
This younger Albus Dumbledore’s long hair and beard were
auburn. Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along
the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing.
“Nice suit, sir,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, but
Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a
short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare
courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded
by high railings. He mounted the few steps leading to the front
door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was
opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron.
“Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole,
who, I believe, is the matron here?”
“Oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore’s
eccentric appearance. “Um . . . just a mo’ . . . MRS. COLE!” she
bellowed over her shoulder.
Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response.
The girl turned back to Dumbledore. “Come in, she’s on ’er way.”
Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the
whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older
Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind
them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward
them. She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious
than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another
aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore.
“. . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has
been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley’s oozing all over his
sheets — chicken pox on top of everything else,” she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and
she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe
had just crossed her threshold.
“Good afternoon,” said Dumbledore, holding out his hand.
Mrs. Cole simply gaped.
“My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting
an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.”
Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was
not a hallucination, she said feebly, “Oh yes. Well — well then —
you’d better come into my room. Yes.”
She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting
room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture
was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him
nervously.
“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and
arrangements for his future,” said Dumbledore.
“Are you family?” asked Mrs. Cole.
“No, I am a teacher,” said Dumbledore. “I have come to offer
Tom a place at my school.”
“What school’s this, then?”
“It is called Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore.
“And how come you’re interested in Tom?”
“We believe he has qualities we are looking for.”
“You mean he’s won a scholarship? How can he have done? He’s
never been entered for one.”
“Well, his name has been down for our school since birth —”
“Who registered him? His parents?”
There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp
woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now
saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the
same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs.
Cole’s desktop.
“Here,” said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed
her the piece of paper, “I think this will make everything clear.”
Mrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment.
“That seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly, handing it
back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that
had certainly not been present a few seconds before.
“Er — may I offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an extrarefined voice.
“Thank you very much,” said Dumbledore, beaming.
It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came
to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she
drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she
smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn’t hesitate to
press his advantage.
“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom
Riddle’s history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?”
“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. “I remember it clear as anything, because I’d just started here myself.
New Year’s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night.
And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came
staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the first. We took her
in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour.”
Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp
of gin.
“Did she say anything before she died?” asked Dumbledore.
“Anything about the boy’s father, for instance?”
“Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be
rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager
audience for her story. “I remember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks
like his papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, because she
was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom,
for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny
name, isn’t it? We wondered whether she came from a circus —
and she said the boy’s surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon
after that without another word.
“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so important
to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle
ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the
orphanage and he’s been here ever since.”
Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another
healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her
cheekbones. Then she said, “He’s a funny boy.”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I thought he might be.”
“He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And
then, when he got a little older, he was . . . odd.”
“Odd in what way?” asked Dumbledore gently.
“Well, he —”
But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or
vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her
gin glass.
“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?”
“Definitely,” said Dumbledore.
“And nothing I say can change that?”
“Nothing,” said Dumbledore.
“You’ll be taking him away, whatever?”
“Whatever,” repeated Dumbledore gravely.
She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust
him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, “He scares the other children.”
“You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore.
“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, “but it’s
very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty
things . . .”
Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he
was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy
cheeks grew rosier still.
“Billy Stubbs’s rabbit . . . well, Tom said he didn’t do it and I
don’t see how he could have done, but even so, it didn’t hang itself
from the rafters, did it?”
“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly.
“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I
know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then” — Mrs.
Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this
time — “on the summer outing — we take them out, you know,
once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside — well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all
we ever got out of them was that they’d gone into a cave with Tom
Riddle. He swore they’d just gone exploring, but something happened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of
things, funny things. . . .”
She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks
were flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don’t think many people will
be sorry to see the back of him.”
“You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?” said Dumbledore. “He will have to return here, at the
very least, every summer.”
“Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty
poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and
Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though
two-thirds of the gin was now gone. “I suppose you’d like to see
him?”
“Very much,” said Dumbledore, rising too.
She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out
instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed.
The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish
tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no
denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up.
“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second
landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She
knocked twice and entered.
“Tom? You’ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton — sorry,
Dunderbore. He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll let him do it.”
Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs.
Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe, a wooden chair, and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs
stretched out in front of him, holding a book.
There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle’s face. Merope
had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature,
tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed
slightly as he took in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. There
was a moment’s silence.
“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking forward and
holding out his hand.
The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the
pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.
“I am Professor Dumbledore.”
“ ‘Professor’?” repeated Riddle. He looked wary. “Is that like
‘doctor’? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look
at me?”
He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just
left.
“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
“I don’t believe you,” said Riddle. “She wants me looked at,
doesn’t she? Tell the truth!”
He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was
almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he
had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was
glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue
smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring,
though he looked, if anything, warier still.
“Who are you?”
“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work
at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my
school — your new school, if you would like to come.”
Riddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the
bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious.
“You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re from, isn’t it?
‘Professor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m not going, see? That old cat’s
the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little
Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they’ll tell
you!”
“I am not from the asylum,” said Dumbledore patiently. “I am a
teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you —”
“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle.
“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard
Riddle’s last words, “is a school for people with special abilities —”
“I’m not mad!”
“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad
people. It is a school of magic.”
There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but
his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore’s, as though trying to catch one of them lying.
“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore.
“It’s . . . it’s magic, what I can do?”
“What is it that you can do?”
“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up
his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. “I can make
things move without touching them. I can make animals do what
I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things
happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want
to.”
His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on
the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in
prayer.
“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own quivering fingers. “I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.”
“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who was no
longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. “You are a wizard.”
Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a
wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him
better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed
somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.
“Are you a wizard too?”
“Yes, I am.”
“Prove it,” said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he
had used when he had said, “Tell the truth.”
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “If, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwarts —”
“Of course I am!”
“Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’ ”
Riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, “I’m sorry, sir. I
meant — please, Professor, could you show me — ?”
Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he
would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical
demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building
full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket
of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner,
and gave the wand a casual flick.
The wardrobe burst into flames.
Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for
howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in
there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.
Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. “Where can I get one of
them?”
“All in good time,” said Dumbledore. “I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.”
And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it.
For the first time, Riddle looked frightened.
“Open the door,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the
wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare
clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though
there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.
“Take it out,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.
“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?” asked
Dumbledore.
Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. “Yes, I
suppose so, sir,” he said finally, in an expressionless voice.
“Open it,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed
without looking at them. Harry, who had expected something
much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo,
a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once
free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the
thin blankets.
“You will return them to their owners with your apologies,” said
Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. “I shall
know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not
tolerated at Hogwarts.”
Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly
and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice,
“Yes, sir.”
“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you not only to
use magic, but to control it. You have — inadvertently, I am sure —
been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated
at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow
your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic — yes, there is
a Ministry — will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new
wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our
laws.”
“Yes, sir,” said Riddle again.
It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained
quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the
cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore
and said baldly, “I haven’t got any money.”
“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a leather
money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a fund at Hogwarts for
those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have
to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but —”
“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, who had
taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and
was now examining a fat gold Galleon.
“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books
and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything —”
“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.
“Certainly, if you —”
“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for
myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you
get to this Diagon Alley — sir?” he added, catching Dumbledore’s
eye.
Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed
Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after
telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the
orphanage, he said, “You will be able to see it, although Muggles
around you — non-magical people, that is — will not. Ask for
Tom the barman — easy enough to remember, as he shares your
name —”
Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an
irksome fly.
“You dislike the name ‘Tom’?”
“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as though he
could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in
spite of himself, he asked, “Was my father a wizard? He was called
Tom Riddle too, they’ve told me.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.
“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died,”
said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. “It must’ve been
him. So — when I’ve got all my stuff — when do I come to this
Hogwarts?”
“All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,” said Dumbledore. “You will leave from King’s Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.”
Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his
hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, “I can speak to snakes. I found
out when we’ve been to the country on trips — they find me, they
whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?”
Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest
power until that moment, determined to impress.
“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s hesitation,
“but not unheard of.”
His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle’s
face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other.
Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.
“Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.”
“I think that will do,” said the white-haired Dumbledore at
Harry’s side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly
through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the presentday office.
“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.
Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.
“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you
told him he was a wizard,” said Harry. “I didn’t believe Hagrid at
first, when he told me.”
“Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use
his word — ‘special,’ ” said Dumbledore.
“Did you know — then?” asked Harry.
“Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?” said Dumbledore. “No, I had no idea that he was
to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by
him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him,
something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone
and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others’
sake as much as his.
“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for
such a young wizard and — most interestingly and ominously of
all — he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw,
they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards:
He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to
punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the
young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . .
‘I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .’ ”
“And he was a Parselmouth,” interjected Harry.
“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with
the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among
the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents
did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.
“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, indicating
the dark sky beyond the windows. “But before we part, I want to
draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just
witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be
discussing in future meetings.
“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I mentioned
that another shared his first name, ‘Tom’?”
Harry nodded.
“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to
other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he
wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as
you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created
the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’ behind which he has been hidden for
so long.
“I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly
self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not
want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will
hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They
are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to
this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You
saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These
were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you
will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this
magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.
“And now, it really is time for bed.”
Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell
upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt’s ring had rested last
time, but the ring was no longer there.
“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.
“The ring’s gone,” said Harry, looking around. “But I thought
you might have the mouth organ or something.”
Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his halfmoon spectacles.
“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth
organ.”
And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood
himself to be dismissed.

C H A P T E R F O U R T E E N
FELIX FELICIS

Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning.
He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about
his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable
patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend’s brutal wind had died
out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little
longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.
“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff
stumps that formed this term’s project, and began pulling on their
protective gloves. “But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing
you all this. I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, but what’s
the point?”
“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he says it’s all
important and it’ll help me survive.”
“I think it’s fascinating,” said Hermione earnestly. “It makes
absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How
else will you find out his weaknesses?”
“So how was Slughorn’s latest party?” Harry asked her thickly
through the gum shield.
“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now putting on
protective goggles. “I mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a
bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so wellconnected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced
us to Gwenog Jones.”
“Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under his own
goggles. “The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?”
“That’s right,” said Hermione. “Personally, I thought she was a
bit full of herself, but —”
“Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout briskly,
bustling over and looking stern. “You’re lagging behind, everybody
else has started, and Neville’s already got his first pod!”
They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a
bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but
clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a
grapefruit.
“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said Ron, adding quietly,
when she had turned away again, “should’ve used Muffliato, Harry.”
“No, we shouldn’t!” said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince
and his spells. “Well, come on . . . we’d better get going. . . .”
She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep
breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.
It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out
of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in
Hermione’s hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs;
Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them
together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike
branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which
closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and
wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like
Neville’s. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the
gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of
wood.
“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden
when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, pushing his goggles up
onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.
“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at
arm’s length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into
it with a look of disgust on her face.
“Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best when they’re
fresh!” called Professor Sprout.
“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them,
“Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no
way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually
asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it
on a night you can come.”
Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst
the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and
squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, “And this is another
party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?”
“Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione.
The pod flew out from under Ron’s fingers and hit the greenhouse glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprout’s head
and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the
pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, I didn’t make
up the name ‘Slug Club’ —”
“ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. “It’s
pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don’t you try
hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King
and Queen Slug —”
“We’re allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who for some
reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, “and I was going to ask
you to come, but if you think it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!”
Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that
he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he
could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of
their conversation.
“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a completely different voice.
“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d rather I
hooked up with McLaggen . . .”
There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient
pod with a trowel.
“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice.
Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.
“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and
the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared
to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry’s presence. Hermione
looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her
copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way
to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish
but also rather pleased with himself.
“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It says we’re
supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . .”
Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped
their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the
stump.
It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as
he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had
had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was
not sure how he felt about it. . . . He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if
Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up?
Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks
when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he
had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And
then, what if they didn’t split up? What if they became like Bill and
Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their
presence, so that he was shut out for good?
“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just
as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl
was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.
The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of
Slughorn’s party. Although Harry watched his two friends more
closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem
any different except that they were a little politer to each other than
usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what
happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn’s dimly lit
room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had
more pressing worries.
Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo’s Hospital with no prospect of
leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry
had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser
short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she
would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was looming, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time
to play.
Harry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout.
With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the
class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were
still zooming around the room, all of Hermione’s creation; nobody
else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.
“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?”
“Wha — ? Yeah, of course!” said Dean excitedly. Over Dean’s
shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his
bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus
would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best
for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.
“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice tonight,
seven o’clock.”
“Right,” said Dean. “Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can’t wait to tell
Ginny!”
He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone
together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird
dropping landed on Seamus’s head as one of Hermione’s canaries
whizzed over them.
Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of
Katie’s substitute. There was much muttering in the common
room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings
than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered,
but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in
the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry
knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized
him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If
they lost . . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse
mutterings. . . .
Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly
that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only
problem was Ron.
Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player
who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season
seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in
half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique
became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming
Demelza Robins in the mouth.
“It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” Ron
shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping
blood everywhere. “I just —”
“Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. “You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!”
“I can fix that,” said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing
his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and saying “Episkey.” “And Ginny,
don’t call Ron a prat, you’re not the Captain of this team —”
“Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought
someone should —”
Harry forced himself not to laugh.
“In the air, everyone, let’s go. . . .”
Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term,
though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when
they were this close to the match.
“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” he said
bracingly and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room
looking reasonably happy with themselves.
“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a hollow voice
when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.
“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly. “You’re the best Keeper I
tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.”
He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back
to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron
was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open
the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower,
however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who
were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued
together.
It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in
Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood
his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage
urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness,
he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great distance away.
“Oi!”
Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around.
“What?” said Ginny.
“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!”
“This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!” said
Ginny.
Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that
Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Dean’s instant dismissal from the team.
“Er . . . c’mon, Ginny,” said Dean, “let’s go back to the common
room. . . .”
“You go!” said Ginny. “I want a word with my dear brother!”
Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the
scene.
“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and
glaring at Ron, “let’s get this straight once and for all. It is none of
your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron —”
“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D’you think I want people saying my sister’s a —”
“A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. “A what, exactly?”
“He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny —” said Harry automatically, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ron’s words.
“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry. “Just because he’s
never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he’s ever
had is from our Auntie Muriel —”
“Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning
maroon.
“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself. “I’ve seen you with
Phlegm, hoping she’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her,
it’s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it!”
Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between
them.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron roared, trying
to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing
in front of her with his arms outstretched. “Just because I don’t do
it in public — !”
Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out
of the way.
“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture
of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?”
“You—”
A streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm and missed
Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.
“Don’t be stupid —”
“Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who sounded
close to tears now. “And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only
you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and that’s because
you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!”
And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron;
the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, appeared around the corner, which broke the tension.
“C’mon,” said Harry, as the sound of Filch’s shuffling feet
reached their ears.
They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor.
“Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in
fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.
Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something
like this. It’s just because she’s Ron’s sister, he told himself. You just
didn’t like seeing her kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister. . . .
But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The monster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the
tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things
like “betrayal of trust” . . . “supposed to be my friend” . . .
“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked abruptly,
as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and
wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron
intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone —
“What?” he said confusedly. “Oh . . . er . . .”
The honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to give it.
However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry’s
face.
“Dilligrout,” he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed
through the portrait hole into the common room.
Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed,
they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts.
Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his
four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for
Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not,
like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron,
and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny
for years now. . . . It was natural that he should feel protective . . .
natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip
Dean limb from limb for kissing her . . . No . . . he would have to
control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .
Ron gave a great grunting snore.
She’s Ron’s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron’s sister. She’s out-ofbounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything.
He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited
for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to
stray anywhere near Ginny.
Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused
by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater’s
bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream
Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny
and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with
an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have
become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average
Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the
peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the
boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first
years for looking at him.
To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear off over the
next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his
Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during
the final Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he failed to
save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at
everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.
“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, who was about
two-thirds Ron’s height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.
“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering
in Ron’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers.
Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today.
Ron . . .” he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot
before saying it, “you’re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest
of them like this and I’m going to kick you off the team.”
He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then
something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom;
all the fight went out of him and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic.”
“You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said Harry
fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. “You can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a mental problem you’ve got!”
“You calling me mental?”
“Yeah, maybe I am!”
They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his
head wearily. “I know you haven’t got any time to find another
Keeper, so I’ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I’m taking myself off the team.”
Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting
Ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being
grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in
the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole
team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined
by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a
distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him
nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope
of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving,
attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than
encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as
ever.
Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not
want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch
even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron
played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of
winning were very slim. . . .
If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .
And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of
inspiration.
Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the
Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and
saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.
The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as
Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.
“Cheer up, Ron!” called Lavender. “I know you’ll be brilliant!”
Ron ignored her.
“Tea?” Harry asked him. “Coffee? Pumpkin juice?”
“Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.
A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of
Ron’s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to
breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.
“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her eyes on
the back of Ron’s head.
“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a
glass of pumpkin juice. “There you go, Ron. Drink up.”
Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke
sharply.
“Don’t drink that, Ron!”
Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.
“Why not?” said Ron.
Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.
“You just put something in that drink.”
“Excuse me?” said Harry.
“You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron’s
drink. You’ve got the bottle in your hand right now!”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, stowing
the little bottle hastily in his pocket.
“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said again,
alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and
said, “Stop bossing me around, Hermione.”
She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could
hear her, she hissed, “You should be expelled for that. I’d never have
believed it of you, Harry!”
“Hark who’s talking,” he whispered back. “Confunded anyone
lately?”
She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go
without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a
serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron,
who was smacking his lips.
“Nearly time,” said Harry blithely.
The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the
stadium.
“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” Harry asked Ron.
“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.
Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes
and waiting in the changing room.
“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron. “And guess
what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the
head yesterday during their practice, and he’s too sore to play! And
even better than that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too!”
“What?” said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. “He’s ill?
What’s wrong with him?”
“No idea, but it’s great for us,” said Ginny brightly. “They’re
playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and he’s an idiot.”
Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes
his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed
he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made
sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the
Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on?
Was he really ill, or was he faking?
“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron. “Malfoy not
playing?”
“Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more animated.
“And Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal scorer, I didn’t fancy —
hey!” he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his
Keeper’s gloves and staring at Harry.
“What?”
“I . . . you . . .” Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both
scared and excited. “My drink . . . my pumpkin juice . . . you
didn’t . . . ?”
Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, “We’ll be
starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on.”
They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos.
One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of
green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides
too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear
the roar of Luna Lovegood’s famous lion-topped hat.
Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate.
“Captains shake hands,” she said, and Harry had his hand
crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. “Mount your
brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . .”
The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from
the frozen ground, and they were away.
Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking
around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was
zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different
to the usual commentator’s started up.
“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to see the
team that Potter’s put together this year. Many thought, given
Ronald Weasley’s patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he
might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship
with the Captain does help. . . .”
These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the
Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to
look toward the commentator’s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy
with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical
megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan’s; Harry recognized
Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.
“Oh, and here comes Slytherin’s first attempt on goal, it’s
Urquhart streaking down the pitch and —”
Harry’s stomach turned over.
“— Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky sometimes, I
suppose. . . .”
“That’s right, Smith, he is,” muttered Harry, grinning to himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all
around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading
sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves,
some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of
Gryffindor’s six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because
Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.
“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a Beater,” said
Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a bit more muscle —”
“Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he zoomed
past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at
Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the
Bludger had found its mark.
It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and
again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the
pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling
now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a
rousing chorus of the old favorite “Weasley Is Our King,” he pretended to conduct them from on high.
“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” said a snide
voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. “Your blood-traitor pal . . .”
Madam Hooch’s back was turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had
already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back. . . .
“And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” said
Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. “Yes, he’s certainly seen
something Potter hasn’t!”
Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he noticed them
collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the
sky — Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped
upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch
was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the
clear blue sky.
Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it
drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary or the crowd, but
Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred
points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now
Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. . . .
“Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation. “How much did
Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?”
He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and
shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering
ball and caught it.
“YES!” Harry yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward
the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized
what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned
the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.
“Ginny, where’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the
team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty
crash, she collided with the commentator’s podium. As the crowd
shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the
wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring;
Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, “Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.”
Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged
Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped a
cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the
Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air and
waving to their supporters.
The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant.
“Party up in the common room, Seamus said!” yelled Dean exuberantly. “C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!”
Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They
were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting
her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined.
“I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep breath. “You
shouldn’t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it’s illegal.”
“What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded Ron.
“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, turning away to
hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning.
“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said Hermi-
one shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast!
Felix Felicis!”
“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both.
“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there
were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!”
“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his
hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that
Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden
potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “I wanted
Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said,
astounded. “But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play.
. . . I honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then
rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. “You added Felix Felicis
to Ron’s juice this morning, that’s why he saved everything! See! I can
save goals without help, Hermione!”
“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d been given
it too!”
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his
broomstick over his shoulder.
“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his
plan to backfire like this, “shall . . . shall we go up to the party,
then?”
“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I’m sick of Ron
at the moment, I don’t know what I’m supposed to have done. . . .”
And she stormed out of the changing room too.
Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle
through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at
him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if
Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum,
not when the offense had occurred so long ago.
Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration
party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers
and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded
by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake
off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match
analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at
his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some
time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would
like to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold
the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing
hopefully at her heels.
“Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He’s over there, the
filthy hypocrite.”
Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full
view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around
Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
“It looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?” said Ginny dispassionately. “But I suppose he’s got to refine his technique somehow.
Good game, Harry.”
She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his
stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer.
Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.
Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would
be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight.
He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and
pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside
seemed to be deserted.
“Hermione?”
He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was
sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just
conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.
“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was just practicing.”
“Yeah . . . they’re — er — really good. . . .” said Harry.
He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering
whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that
she had merely left the room because the party was a little too
rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron
seems to be enjoying the celebrations.”
“Er . . . does he?” said Harry.
“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione. “He wasn’t
exactly hiding it, was — ?”
The door behind them burst open. To Harry’s horror, Ron came
in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.
“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and
Hermione.
“Oops!” said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her.
There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was
staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd
mixture of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, Harry! Wondered
where you’d got to!”
Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like
a strange, feathery model of the solar system.
“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she said quietly.
“She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.”
She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry
glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had
happened.
“Oppugno!” came a shriek from the doorway.
Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron,
her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail
of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face
with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at
every bit of flesh they could reach.
“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive
fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through
it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.

C H A P T E R F I F T E E N
THE UNBREAKABLE VOW

Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already single-handedly
delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of
the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of
suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge
underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past,
which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however,
Harry’s frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually
good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that he was
able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes
between classes.
Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours
a cause for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing,
S
joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring
for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price.
Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not
kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely
ever to speak to each other again.
Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts
from Hermione’s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful
tone.
“She can’t complain,” he told Harry. “She snogged Krum. So
she’s found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it’s a free
country. I haven’t done anything wrong.”
Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book
they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning
(Quintessence: A Quest). Determined as he was to remain friends
with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with
his mouth shut tight.
“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled. “I
mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party
with her, but she never said . . . just as friends . . . I’m a free
agent. . . .”
Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron’s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the
loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the
words “Krum” and “can’t complain” again.
Hermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to
her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly
wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was
doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron
was there, so Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant
that their conversations were held in whispers.
“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” said Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind
them. “I really couldn’t care less.”
She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his
voice might soon vanish from lack of use. He bent a little lower
over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on
Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the Prince’s
useful additions to Libatius Borage’s text.
“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few moments, “you
need to be careful.”
“For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse
whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, “I am not giving
back this book, I’ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than
Snape or Slughorn have taught me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to
her. “I’m talking about earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just
before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there,
including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a
love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take
them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred
and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably
work —”
“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry. It
seemed extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules
could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said
Hermione scornfully. “They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt
whether even the Half-Blood Prince” — she gave the book another
nasty look — “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different
love potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with you, that’ll
stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a chance. It’s tomorrow
night, they’re getting desperate.”
“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, who was
still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help,
despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways
that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform
Legilimency.
“Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane
looked like she meant business,” said Hermione grimly.
She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was
writing her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with
her quill. Harry watched her with his mind a long way away.
“Hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “I thought Filch had
banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?”
“And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has
banned?” asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay.
“But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come
these girls are able to bring love potions into school?”
“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough
potions,” said Hermione. “It’s part of their Owl Order Service.”
“You know a lot about it.”
Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his
copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me
in the summer,” she said coldly. “I don’t go around putting potions
in people’s drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as
bad. . . .”
“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. “The point is,
Filch is being fooled, isn’t he? These girls are getting stuff into the
school disguised as something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have
brought the necklace into the school — ?”
“Oh, Harry . . . not that again . . .”
“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry.
“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses,
and concealment charms, don’t they? They’re used to find Dark
Magic and Dark objects. They’d have picked up a powerful curse,
like the one on that necklace, within seconds. But something that’s
just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway,
love potions aren’t Dark or dangerous —”
“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda
Vane.
“— so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from —”
Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had
moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They
waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam
Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like
parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly
by the lamp she was carrying.
“The library is now closed,” she said. “Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct — what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?”
“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, snatching his
copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it
with a clawlike hand.
“Despoiled!” she hissed. “Desecrated! Befouled!”
“It’s just a book that’s been written on!” said Harry, tugging it
out of her grip.
She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who
had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away.
“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. Why did
you have to bring that stupid book?”
“It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or d’you think
she overheard you being rude about Filch? I’ve always thought there
might be something going on between them. . . .”
“Oh, ha ha . . .”
Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they
made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the
common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam
Pince were secretly in love with each other.
“Baubles,” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive
password.
“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, and she
swung forward to admit them.
“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed
through the portrait hole. “Fancy a gillywater?”
Hermione gave him a “what-did-I-tell-you?” look over her
shoulder.
“No thanks,” said Harry quickly. “I don’t like it much.”
“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a box into his
hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons, they’ve got firewhisky in them. My
gran sent them to me, but I don’t like them.”
“Oh — right — thanks a lot,” said Harry, who could not think
what else to say. “Er — I’m just going over here with . . .”
He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.
“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly. “Sooner you ask someone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you can —”
But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron
and Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair.
“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only
seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girls’ dormitory
without another word.
Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one
more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn’s party, after
which he and Ron would depart together for the Burrow. It now
seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with
each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the
break would give them time to calm down, think better of their
behavior. . . .
But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had
just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be
changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed
unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache;
Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply
amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again.
She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things
behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron’s just
now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.
He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls’ bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood,
who was patting her vaguely on the back.
“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?”
“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .”
He held out her books.
“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things
and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her
eyes on her pencil case. “Thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. . . .”
And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer
words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any.
“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it was Moaning
Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about that Ron Weasley. . . .”
“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry.
“He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” said Luna, as
they set off down the corridor together. “But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.”
“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack
of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite
like her. “So have you had a good term?”
“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely without the
D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our
Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day —”
“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me
tonight?”
The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop
them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger
speaking.
Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise.
“Slughorn’s party? With you?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “We’re supposed to bring guests, so I
thought you might like . . . I mean . . .” He was keen to make his
intentions perfectly clear. “I mean, just as friends, you know. But if
you don’t want to . . .”
He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to.
“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, beaming
as he had never seen her beam before. “Nobody’s ever asked me to
a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for
the party? Should I do mine too?”
“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione
to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight
o’clock then.”
“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of them
jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed right
underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them.
“Potty asked Loony to go to the party! Potty lurves Loony! Potty
luuuuurves Looooooony!”
And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty loves Loony!”
“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And sure
enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that
Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn’s party.
“You could’ve taken anyone!” said Ron in disbelief over dinner.
“Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?”
“Don’t call her that, Ron,” snapped Ginny, pausing behind
Harry on her way to join friends. “I’m really glad you’re taking her,
Harry, she’s so excited.”
And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried
to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party,
but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron
looking at her furtively.
“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly.
“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered
Ron.
“What did you have to imitate her for?”
“She laughed at my mustache!”
“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.”
But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived
with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron’s neck.
“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends.
“Hi,” said Harry. “How’re you? You’re staying at Hogwarts,
then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.”
“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” said Parvati. “That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn’t
been anything since . . . Oh, hi, Hermione!”
Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling
guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He
looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.
“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. “Are you going to Slughorn’s party tonight?”
“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, though, it
sounds like it’s going to be really good. . . . You’re going, aren’t you?”
“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re —”
There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a
blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had
not seen or heard anything.
“— we’re going up to the party together.”
“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you mean?”
“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who almost” —
she put a great deal of emphasis on the word — “became Gryffindor Keeper.”
“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, wide-eyed.
“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a most
un-Hermione-ish giggle.
“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece of gossip.
“Wow, you like your Quidditch players, don’t you? First Krum,
then McLaggen . . .”
“I like really good Quidditch players,” Hermione corrected her,
still smiling. “Well, see you . . . Got to go and get ready for the
party. . . .”
She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together
to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever
heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was
left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get
revenge.
When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night,
he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of
whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached
Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she
had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and
her Spectrespecs.
“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?”
“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?”
“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. “Did you hear, there’s
supposed to be a vampire coming?”
“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna.
“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the Minister
of Magic?”
“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. “Father wrote a
very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from
Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody
from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get
out!”
Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was
a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father’s bizarre
views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already
approaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of laughter, music,
and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they
took.
Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn’s office was much larger than
the usual teacher’s study. The ceiling and walls had been draped
with emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as
though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and
stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp
dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were
fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner;
a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in
conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their
way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy
silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.
“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and
Luna had squeezed in through the door. “Come in, come in, so
many people I’d like you to meet!”
Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking
jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he might have been hoping
to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the
party; Harry seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him.
“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of
mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires —
and, of course, his friend Sanguini.”
Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed
Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini,
who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes,
merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was
standing close to him, looking curious and excited.
“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering
shortsightedly up into Harry’s face. “I was saying to Professor
Slughorn only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter
for which we have all been waiting?’ ”
“Er,” said Harry, “were you?”
“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. “But seriously” — his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike —
“I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to
know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to
grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why,
we could have the book finished within months. And all with very
little effort on your part, I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t
quite — Sanguini, stay here!” added Worple, suddenly stern, for
the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a
rather hungry look in his eye. “Here, have a pasty,” said Worple,
seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand
before turning his attention back to Harry.
“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea —”
“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and I’ve just
seen a friend of mine, sorry.”
He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just
seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked
like two members of the Weird Sisters.
“Hermione! Hermione!”
“Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!”
“What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione looked
distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way
out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare.
“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left Cormac,” she
said. “Under the mistletoe,” she added in explanation, as Harry
continued to look questioningly at her.
“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her severely.
“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione dispassionately. “I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought,
on the whole —”
“You considered Smith?” said Harry, revolted.
“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, McLaggen
makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let’s go this way, we’ll be able to
see him coming, he’s so tall. . . .”
The three of them made their way over to the other side of the
room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late
that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.
“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney.
“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, focusing
upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry
again. “I haven’t seen you in my classes lately. . . .”
“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna.
“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an angry,
drunken titter. “Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would
have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school
Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no . . .
we share classes. . . . It’s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you
know . . .”
Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry.
Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer
to Hermione and said, “Let’s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?”
Hermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think I’d stoop
that low?”
Harry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can ask out
McLaggen —”
“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. “I’ve got no
plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have
happened at Keeper tryouts.”
“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall apart again,
and we’ll lose the next match —”
“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys care about?
Cormac hasn’t asked me one single question about myself, no, I’ve
just been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac
McLaggen’ nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!”
She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one
moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two
guffawing witches and vanished.
“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way through
the throng a minute later.
“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna’s
conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones,
noticing him for the first time.
“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically.
“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. “The rumors!
The stories! ‘The Chosen One’! Of course, I have known for a very
long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why
have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the
subject is of the utmost importance!”
“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most important!” said a
loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney’s other
side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead
in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I don’t
think I’ve ever known such a natural at Potions!” said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you
know — like his mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind
of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus —”
And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed
to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them.
“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” hiccuped
Slughorn happily. “I was just talking about Harry’s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught
him for five years!”
Trapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders, Snape
looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed.
“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach
Potter anything at all.”
“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. “You should
have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death —
never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think
even you, Severus —”
“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who
felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to
start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.
“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, Harry?” asked
Slughorn.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration,
Herbology . . .”
“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said Snape,
with the faintest sneer.
“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry defiantly.
“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn.
“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. “The Aurors are part of the
Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They’re working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease.”
Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh.
Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging
from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw
something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy
being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.
“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the
maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, “I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have
been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out.
Did you issue him with an invitation?”
Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch’s grip, looking furious.
“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “I was trying to gatecrash, happy?”
“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the
glee on his face. “You’re in trouble, you are! Didn’t the headmaster
say that nighttime prowling’s out, unless you’ve got permission,
didn’t he, eh?”
“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said Slughorn, waving a
hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a
party. Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay,
Draco.”
Filch’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy
look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and . . . was it possible? . . . a little afraid?
But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch
had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy
had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for
his generosity, and Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again.
“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy’s
thanks. “I did know your grandfather, after all. . . .”
“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy quickly.
“Said you were the best potion-maker he’d ever known. . . .”
Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued
him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It
was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the
first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that
Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish
tinge to his skin.
“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly.
“Oh, now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, “it’s Christmas, don’t be too hard —”
“I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,” said Snape curtly. “Follow me, Draco.”
They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful.
Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back
in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom.”
“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as
he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang
Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested.
It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak
out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was
quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and
Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked
by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn’s office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons . . . or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin
common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as
he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement,
he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.
“. . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled —”
“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?”
“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and
foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.”
“Who suspects me?” said Malfoy angrily. “For the last time, I
didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had an enemy no one
knows about — don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid, but it won’t work — I can stop you!”
There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah . . . Aunt
Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts
are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?”
“I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don’t want
you butting in!”
Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . .
What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this —
Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?
“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have
feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to
come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there,
Draco —”
“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” jeered
Malfoy.
There was another pause. Then Snape said, “You know perfectly
well that I do not wish to do either of those things.”
“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!”
“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had
to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. “I am trying
to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made
the Unbreakable Vow, Draco —”
“Looks like you’ll have to break it, then, because I don’t need
your protection! It’s my job, he gave it to me and I’m doing it, I’ve
got a plan and it’s going to work, it’s just taking a bit longer than I
thought it would!”
“What is your plan?”
“It’s none of your business!”
“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you —”
“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not alone!”
“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these
are elementary mistakes —”
“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn’t put
them in detention!”
“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice had
risen excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass
their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they
will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres —”
“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark
Arts — it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts —”
“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where
do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known
how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering
around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing
your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle —”
“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my side,
better people!”
“Then why not confide in me, and I can —”
“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my glory!”
There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, “You are
speaking like a child. I quite understand that your father’s capture
and imprisonment has upset you, but —”
Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard Malfoy’s footsteps
on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just
as it burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past
the open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant corner, and
out of sight.
Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as
Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing.

C H A P T E R S I X T E E N
A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS

So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to
help him?”
“If you ask that once more,” said Harry, “I’m going to stick this
sprout —”
“I’m only checking!” said Ron. They were standing alone at the
Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs.
Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.
“Yes, Snape was offering to help him!” said Harry. “He said he’d
promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something —”
“An Unbreakable Vow?” said Ron, looking stunned. “Nah, he
can’t have. . . . Are you sure?”
“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry. “Why, what does it mean?”
“Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .”
“I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What
happens if you break it, then?”
“You die,” said Ron simply. “Fred and George tried to get me to
make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding
hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went
mental,” said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. “Only
time I’ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.”
“Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock —”
“I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins entered the
kitchen.
“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and everything.
Bless them.”
“I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said Ron
grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do it by magic!”
“But meanwhile,” said George, sitting down at the kitchen table
and putting his feet up on it, “we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a — whoops-a-daisy!”
“You made me do that!” said Ron angrily, sucking his cut
thumb. “You wait, when I’m seventeen —”
“I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical
skills,” yawned Fred.
“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,” said
George, “what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young
lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?”
Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he
turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own business.”
“What a snappy retort,” said Fred. “I really don’t know how you
think of them. No, what we wanted to know was . . . how did it
happen?”
“What d’you mean?”
“Did she have an accident or something?”
“What?”
“Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!”
Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the
sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with
one lazy flick of his wand.
“Ron!” she said furiously. “Don’t you ever let me see you throwing knives again!”
“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his breath, as
he turned back to the sprout mountain.
“Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so
Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.”
“No problem,” said George.
“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves Harry and
Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny —”
“— that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas —” muttered Fred.
“— everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have a bed,
anyway,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.
“Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?” asked Fred.
Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. “No, he’s busy, I
expect, at the Ministry.”
“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left
the kitchen. “One of the two. Well, let’s get going, then, George.”
“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Can’t you help us with
these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we’ll be free
too!”
“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. “It’s very
character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic,
makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs —”
“— and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added George,
throwing the paper airplane at him, “I wouldn’t chuck knives at
them. Just a little hint. We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty
girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous . . . almost like real magic. . . .”
“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off
across the snowy yard. “Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and
then we could’ve gone too.”
“I couldn’t,” said Harry. “I promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t
wander off while I’m staying here.”
“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then
said, “Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and
Malfoy saying to each other?”
“Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop
to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word
with your dad too.”
“Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though.”
“I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was
refusing to tell Snape.”
There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, “ ’Course,
you know what they’ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of
them? They’ll say Snape isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was
just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to.”
“They didn’t hear him,” said Harry flatly. “No one’s that good an
actor, not even Snape.”
“Yeah . . . I’m just saying, though,” said Ron.
Harry turned to face him, frowning. “You think I’m right,
though?”
“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But they’re all
convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they?”
Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this
would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could
hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer
help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing. . . .
This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared
from Slughorn’s parry before he returned to it, or so he had been
informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed
by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had
left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to
wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very
important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not
entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender
had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him
at the time.
Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry
felt fully justified in saying “I told you so,” which he had done several times to Ron already.
Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was
working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve
night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living
room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like
sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron
were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was
actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he
pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold,
stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its
back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever
seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.
They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast
by Mrs. Weasley’s favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice
was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed
to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a
scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong
Love,” Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with
Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though
hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner
and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina’s voice.
Oh, come and stir my cauldron,
And if you do it right,
I’ll boil you up some hot strong love
To keep you warm tonight.
“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. Weasley,
wiping her eyes on her knitting. “Do you remember, Arthur?”
“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over
the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh yes . . . marvelous tune . . .”
With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at
Harry, who was sitting next to him.
“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward the wireless
as Celestina broke into the chorus. “Be over soon.”
“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy at the
Ministry?”
“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were getting
anywhere, but of the three arrests we’ve made in the last couple of
months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater — only
don’t repeat that, Harry,” he added quickly, looking much more
awake all of a sudden.
“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” asked Harry.
“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know Dumbledore’s tried
appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. . . . I mean, anybody
who has actually interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a
Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as
though they’re making some progress, and ‘three arrests’ sounds
better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases’. . . but again, this is
all top secret. . . .”
“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a moment,
wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he
marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called
“You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.”
“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we
were setting off for school?”
“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went and
searched the Malfoys’ house. There was nothing, either broken or
whole, that shouldn’t have been there.”
“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked . . . but this
is something different. . . . Well, something more . . .”
And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between
Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin’s head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there
was silence, except for Celestina’s crooning.
Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone?
It’s left me for a spell . . .
“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, “that Snape
was simply pretending — ?”
“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy’s up to?” said Harry quickly. “Yeah, I thought you’d say that.
But how do we know?”
“It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin unexpectedly. He had
turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr.
Weasley. “It’s Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus,
and that ought to be good enough for all of us.”
“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledore’s wrong
about Snape —”
“People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or
not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust
Severus.”
“But Dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued Harry. “He says
it himself. And you” — he looked Lupin straight in the eye — “do
you honestly like Snape?”
“I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin. “No, Harry, I am
speaking the truth,” he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expression. “We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much
bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at
Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every
month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.”
“But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, so you had
to leave!” said Harry angrily.
Lupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out anyway. We
both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much
worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me
healthy. I must be grateful.”
“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore
watching him!” said Harry.
“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin with a
faint smile. “And I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all
means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do
not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect
him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on
Dumbledore’s orders that Severus questioned Draco.”
. . . and now you’ve torn it quite apart
I’ll thank you to give back my heart!
Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and
loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined
in with enthusiastically.
“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, what an ’orrible —”
“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley loudly,
leaping to his feet. “Who wants eggnog?”
“What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked Lupin, as Mr.
Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else
stretched and broke into conversation.
“Oh, I’ve been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost literally.
That’s why I haven’t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to
you would have been something of a giveaway.”
“What do you mean?”
“I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said Lupin.
“Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s look of incomprehension.
“Nearly all of them are on Voldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a
spy and here I was . . . ready-made.”
He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled
more warmly as he went on, “I am not complaining; it is necessary
work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having
tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned
normal society and live on the margins, stealing — and sometimes
killing — to eat.”
“How come they like Voldemort?”
“They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,”
said Lupin. “And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .”
“Who’s Greyback?”
“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed convulsively in
his lap. “Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf
alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey
in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite
them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise
them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash
him upon people’s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually
produces good results.”
Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who bit me.”
“What?” said Harry, astonished. “When — when you were a
kid, you mean?”
“Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very
long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I
even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that.
At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring
that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man
Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend
that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much
headway against Greyback’s insistence that we werewolves deserve
blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a
problem —”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of
James. He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many
people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved
rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of
thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a
rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded
him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is
this a title you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The HalfBlood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his
old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented.
One of them was Levicorpus —”
“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,”
said Lupin reminiscently. “There were a few months in my fifth
year when you couldn’t move for being hoisted into the air by your
ankle.”
“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used
it on Snape.”
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved
the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding.
“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it was very
popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. . . .”
“But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,”
Harry persisted.
“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of fashion
like everything else.”
He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, “James was a
pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him
‘Prince.’ ”
Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you?”
“Definitely not.”
“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s
helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.”
“How old is this book, Harry?”
“I dunno, I’ve never checked.”
“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the
Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin.
Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A
Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone,
once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to
go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic
bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.
Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his
trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before
getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he
finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father’s
friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed,
Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and
rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and
the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of
creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .
“She’s got to be joking. . . .”
Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the
end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny
window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front
of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.
“What’s that?” asked Harry.
“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted. “She can’t
honestly think I’d wear . . .”
Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:
My Sweetheart
“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of
Fred and George.”
“If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight
under his pillow, “I — I — I’ll —”
“Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning. “Come on, would I?”
“How could she think I’d like something like that, though?”
Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.
“Well, think back,” said Harry. “Have you ever let it slip that
you’d like to go out in public with the words ‘My Sweetheart’
round your neck?”
“Well . . . we don’t really talk much,” said Ron. “It’s mainly . . .”
“Snogging,” said Harry.
“Well, yeah,” said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, “Is
Hermione really going out with McLaggen?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “They were at Slughorn’s party together,
but I don’t think it went that well.”
Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his
stocking.
Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch
worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box
of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a
slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading To Master, From Kreacher.
Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked.
“Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still being searched
at the Ministry,” replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel
suspiciously.
“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually
give their house-elves Christmas presents?” asked Harry, prodding
the parcel cautiously.
“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see what it is
before you start feeling guilty.”
A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his
camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.
“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very thoughtful.”
“I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, which
sobered Ron up at once.
Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for
Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared,
Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley
herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat
glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.
“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they beautiful?”
“Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now
we’re washing our own socks,” said George, waving an airy hand.
“Parsnips, Remus?”
“Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny cheerfully,
leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt
up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.
“ ’Ow ’orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.
“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?”
In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying;
Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned
meekly to the boat.
“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, when she had
finished kissing Bill in thanks. “She is always knocking —”
“I invited dear Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. Weasley,
setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur.
“But she wouldn’t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?”
“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said
Lupin. “But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn’t she?”
“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the impression she
was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.”
She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault
she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but
Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of
turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a
long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had
with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man
who knew all about Patronuses?
“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. “Snape
said so anyway. I didn’t know that could happen. Why would your
Patronus change?”
Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before
saying slowly, “Sometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional upheaval . . .”
“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. “Hey . . . it couldn’t be — ?”
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her
chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out
of the kitchen window. “Arthur — it’s Percy!”
“What?”
Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the
window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was
Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed
glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.
“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!”
And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet
was following along in Percy’s wake, limping slightly, his mane of
graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of
them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do
more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and
there stood Percy.
There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Percy said rather
stiffly, “Merry Christmas, Mother.”
“Oh, Percy!” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his
arms.
Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.
“You must forgive this intrusion,” he said, when Mrs. Weasley
looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. “Percy and I
were in the vicinity — working, you know — and he couldn’t resist dropping in and seeing you all.”
But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of
the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and
stared over everybody else’s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George
were all observing him, stony-faced.
“Please, come in, sit down, Minister!” fluttered Mrs. Weasley,
straightening her hat. “Have a little purkey, or some tooding. . . . I
mean —”
“No, no, my dear Molly,” said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that
he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house.
“I don’t want to intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t
wanted to see you all so badly. . . .”
“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss
him.
“. . . We’ve only looked in for five minutes, so I’ll have a stroll
around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure
you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your
charming garden . . . Ah, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t
he take a stroll with me?”
The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find
Scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know Harry’s name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the
Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also
had clean plates.
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence.
He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just
been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must
be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could
speak to Harry alone.
“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen
from his chair. “Fine,” he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth
to speak.
“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass
through the door ahead of him. “We’ll just take a turn around the
garden, and Percy and I’ll be off. Carry on, everyone!”
Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys’ overgrown,
snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He
had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough
and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler
hat.
“Charming,” said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and
looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants.
“Charming.”
Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching
him.
“I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said Scrimgeour,
after a few moments. “Did you know that?”
“No,” said Harry truthfully.
“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very
protective of you,” said Scrimgeour. “Natural, of course, natural,
after what you’ve been through. . . . Especially what happened at
the Ministry . . .”
He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige,
so he went on, “I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you
ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has — most understandably, as I say — prevented this.”
Still, Harry said nothing, waiting.
“The rumors that have flown around!” said Scrimgeour. “Well,
of course, we both know how these stories get distorted . . . all these
whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being ‘the Chosen One’. . .”
They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.
“. . . I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with
you?”
Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not.
He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, and
the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught
the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree.
Finally, he decided on the truth . . . or a bit of it.
“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.”
“Have you, have you . . .” said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out
of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its
head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. “And what has
Dumbledore told you, Harry?”
“Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry. He kept his voice as
pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour’s tone, too, was light and
friendly as he said, “Oh, of course, if it’s a question of confidences,
I wouldn’t want you to divulge . . . no, no . . . and in any case, does
it really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One’ or not?”
Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding. “I don’t really know what you mean, Minister.”
“Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,” said Scrimgeour with a laugh. “But to the Wizarding community at large . . .
it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s what people believe that’s important.”
Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were
heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The
gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its
roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.
“People believe you are ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” said Scrimgeour. “They think you quite the hero — which, of course, you
are, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced HeWho-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,” he pressed on,
without waiting for a reply, “the point is, you are a symbol of hope
for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who
might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named — well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And
I can’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider
it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give
everyone a boost.”
The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now
tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground.
Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry
to the gnome, “Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you,
Harry?”
“I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said Harry slowly.
“ ‘Stand alongside the Ministry’ . . . What does that mean?”
“Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,” said Scrimgeour. “If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry
from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample
opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of
the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish
an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very
easily. . . .”
Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores
Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?
“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few
points, “you’d like to give the impression that I’m working for the
Ministry?”
“It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved,
Harry,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. “ ‘The Chosen One,’ you know . . . It’s all
about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening. . . .”
“But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” said Harry,
still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, “won’t that seem as
though I approve of what the Ministry’s up to?”
“Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, that’s
partly why we’d like —”
“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly. “You see,
I don’t like some of the things the Ministry’s doing. Locking up
Stan Shunpike, for instance.”
Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. “I would not expect you to understand,” he said,
and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as
Harry had been. “These are dangerous times, and certain measures
need to be taken. You are sixteen years old —”
“Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t think
Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said Harry. “You’re making Stan
a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.”
They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour
said, with no pretense at warmth, “I see. You prefer — like your
hero, Dumbledore — to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?”
“I don’t want to be used,” said Harry.
“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the Ministry!”
“Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check that people
really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,” said
Harry, his temper rising now. “You’re doing what Barty Crouch
did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we’ve got
Fudge, pretending everything’s lovely while people get murdered
right under his nose, or we’ve got you, chucking the wrong people
into jail and trying to pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!”
“So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour.
“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said Harry, with
a bitter laugh. “Not to you anyway.”
“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly. “It was
tactless —”
“No, it was honest,” said Harry. “One of the only honest things
you’ve said to me. You don’t care whether I live or die, but you do
care that I help you convince everyone you’re winning the war
against Voldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister. . . .”
He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his
cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him
to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.
“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying
to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn’t so keen
to be pals last year.”
They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The
gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now
sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of
the rhododendron bush.
“What is Dumbledore up to?” said Scrimgeour brusquely.
“Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?”
“No idea,” said Harry.
“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said Scrimgeour,
“would you?”
“No, I wouldn’t,” said Harry.
“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out by other
means.”
“You can try,” said Harry indifferently. “But you seem cleverer
than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed
he’s not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d
leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.”
There was a long pause.
“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,”
said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed
glasses. “Dumbledore’s man through and through, aren’t you, Potter?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that out.”
And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back
toward the house.

C H A P T E R S E V E N T E E N
A SLUGGISH MEMORY

Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron,
and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the
Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school.
Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley,
Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very
little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since
Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his
glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George,
and Ginny all claimed credit).
“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs.
Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. “It’s okay. . . .”
“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his mother
to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or about Percy. He’s such a
prat, it’s not really a loss, is it?”
Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in
her arms.
“Promise me you’ll look after yourself. . . . Stay out of trouble. . . .”
“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet life, you
know me.”
She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, then, all of
you. . . .”
Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted “Hogwarts!”
He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs.
Weasley’s tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very
fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which
were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then
he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in
Professor McGonagall’s office. She barely glanced up from her
work as he clambered out over the grate.
“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.”
“No, Professor.”
Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came
spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them
trooped out of McGonagall’s office and off toward Gryffindor
Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed;
the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow
than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see
Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.
“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat
Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his
loud voice.
“No,” she said.
“What d’you mean, ‘no’?”
“There is a new password,” she said. “And please don’t shout.”
“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?”
“Harry! Ginny!”
Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves.
“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down to visit
Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she said breathlessly.
“Did you have a good Christmas?”
“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim —”
“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither
looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. “Oh,
hang on — password. Abstinence.”
“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole.
“What’s up with her?” asked Harry.
“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said Hermione,
rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room.
“She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine
in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor.
Anyway . . .”
She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a
scroll of parchment with Dumbledore’s writing on it.
“Great,” said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next
lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night.
“I’ve got loads to tell him — and you. Let’s sit down —”
But at that moment there was a loud squeal of “Won-Won!” and
Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself
into Ron’s arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a
tinkling laugh and said, “There’s a table over here. . . . Coming,
Ginny?”
“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, though Harry
could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic.
Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling
match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table.
“So how was your Christmas?”
“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Nothing special. How was it at WonWon’s?”
“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry. “Look, Hermione, can’t
you — ?”
“No, I can’t,” she said flatly. “So don’t even ask.”
“I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas —”
“It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old
wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted
to tell me?”
She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry
dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard
between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in
thought for a moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?”
“— he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing?”
“Well, yes,” said Hermione.
“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said grudgingly. “But
this definitely proves Malfoy’s planning something, you can’t deny
that.”
“No, I can’t,” she answered slowly.
“And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I said!”
“Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention Voldemort’s
name?”
Harry frowned, trying to remember. “I’m not sure . . . Snape
definitely said ‘your master,’ and who else would that be?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “Maybe his
father?”
She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even
noticing Lavender tickling Ron. “How’s Lupin?”
“Not great,” said Harry, and he told her all about Lupin’s mission
among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. “Have you
heard of this Fenrir Greyback?”
“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sounding startled. “And so have
you, Harry!”
“When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened . . .”
“No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin
with him!” said Hermione. “Back in Knockturn Alley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend
and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress!”
Harry gaped at her. “I forgot! But this proves Malfoy’s a Death
Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling
him what to do?”
“It is pretty suspicious,” breathed Hermione. “Unless . . .”
“Oh, come on,” said Harry in exasperation, “you can’t get round
this one!”
“Well . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat.”
“You’re unbelievable, you are,” said Harry, shaking his head.
“We’ll see who’s right. . . . You’ll be eating your words, Hermione,
just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour
as well. . . .”
And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them
abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought
that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year,
they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.
The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for
the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room
notice boards overnight.

Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the
notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom.
Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when
Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and
trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry turned to see Hermione
stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind
with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with
them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red
and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped
up to walk with Neville.
“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain
that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. “Should
be a laugh, eh?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “Maybe it’s better when you do it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for
the ride.”
“I forgot you’d already done it. . . . I’d better pass my test first
time,” said Ron, looking anxious. “Fred and George did.”
“Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?”
“Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his arms out
from his body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George
didn’t go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . .”
“When can we take the actual test?”
“Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me!”
“Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the
castle . . .”
“Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I
wanted.”
Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming
lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and
reappear at will.
“How cool will it be when we can just —” Seamus clicked his
fingers to indicate disappearance. “Me cousin Fergus does it just to
annoy me, you wait till I can do it back . . . He’ll never have another peaceful moment. . . .”
Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of
pure water that was the object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out
a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor
Flitwick flat on his face.
“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of
his wand and set Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him. Side-AlongApparition, you know.”
“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their
heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of
the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth
years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed
awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable
it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight
that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to
return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson
with Dumbledore.
The lamps in Dumbledore’s office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledore’s hands lay
on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as
ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for
perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know
eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to
discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and
Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.
“I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s not very happy with me.”
“No,” sighed Dumbledore. “He is not very happy with me
either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but
battle on.”
Harry grinned.
“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry’s doing a wonderful job.”
Dumbledore smiled.
“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his last days in
office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he
sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your
support —”
“After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry angrily. “After
Umbridge?”
“I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not
die when he left office. Within hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment
we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you —”
“So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out. “It was in the
Daily Prophet.”
“The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,” said
Dumbledore, “if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued.
Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.”
“He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore’s man through and
through.’ ”
“How very rude of him.”
“I told him I was.”
Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it
again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry’s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized
that Dumbledore’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and
stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.
“I am very touched, Harry.”
“Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at
Hogwarts,” said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees.
“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. “He has
even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set
Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx
Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.”
“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, hoping for
more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore
merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.
“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you to know
either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there’s anything else — ?”
“There is, actually, sir,” said Harry. “It’s about Malfoy and
Snape.”
“Professor Snape, Harry.”
“Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party . . .
well, I followed them, actually. . . .”
Dumbledore listened to Harry’s story with an impassive face.
When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments,
then said, “Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that
you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great
importance.”
“Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously. “Professor, did you understand — ?”
“Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I
understood everything you told me,” said Dumbledore, a little
sharply. “I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me
anything that causes me disquiet.”
Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was
going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered
Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had
already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or
was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not
to be?
“So, sir,” said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice,
“you definitely still trust — ?”
“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,”
said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore.
“My answer has not changed.”
“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.
“And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.”
Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused
to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case
against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore
shook his head.
“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of
friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more
important than anything the other might have to contribute!”
“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir,” said
Harry stiffly.
“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said Dumbledore
briskly. “I have two more memories to show you this evening, both
obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, I
think, the most important I have collected.”
Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to
be gained by arguing further.
“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson
poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused
my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned
him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.
“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom
Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the
other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over
his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. “How
soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could
talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. The
knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of
self-importance.
“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins
with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it
reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff
almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet,
and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.”
“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him
at the orphanage?” asked Harry.
“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was
possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was
resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.”
Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had
opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledore’s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they
did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something. . . .
“But you didn’t really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the
Riddle who came out of that diary said, ‘Dumbledore never
seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.’ ”
“Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,” said Dumbledore. “I had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend
that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was
very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was
careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back
what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me
as he charmed so many of my colleagues.
“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group
of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term,
although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no
affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour
within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the
weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory,
and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them
more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the
first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open
wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked
by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening
of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As
you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime.
“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. “Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him;
they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left
Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few
who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and
questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.
“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was
obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he
had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how
he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace
of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the
lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had
never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he
dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised
mother’s family — the woman whom, you will remember, he had
thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he
knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name. Finally, after painstaking research through old books
of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s
surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his
Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a
small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the
gleaming mass into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we
have experienced it. Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until
his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon
a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.
It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time
Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts’ house was now
more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The
ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy
and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots.
The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the
feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see
neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the
fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But
then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked
awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his
left.
The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an oldfashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale,
dark-haired, and handsome — the teenage Voldemort.
Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found
the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each
other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at
his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.
“YOU!” he bellowed. “YOU!”
And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft.
“Stop.”
Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table,
sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle.
There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The
man broke it.
“You speak it?”
“Yes, I speak it,” said Riddle. He moved forward into the room,
allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help
but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of
fear. His face merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.
“Where is Marvolo?” he asked.
“Dead,” said the other. “Died years ago, didn’t he?”
Riddle frowned.
“Who are you, then?”
“I’m Morfin, ain’t I?”
“Marvolo’s son?”
“ ’Course I am, then . . .”
Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see
Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on
his right hand.
“I thought you was that Muggle,” whispered Morfin. “You look
mighty like that Muggle.”
“What Muggle?” said Riddle sharply.
“That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives
in the big house over the way,” said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly
upon the floor between them. “You look right like him. Riddle. But
he’s older now, in ’e? He’s older’n you, now I think on it. . . .”
Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching
the edge of the table for support. “He come back, see,” he added
stupidly.
Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, “Riddle came back?”
“Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!” said Morfin,
spitting on the floor again. “Robbed us, mind, before she ran off!
Where’s the locket, eh, where’s Slytherin’s locket?”
Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a
rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, “Dishonored us,
she did, that little slut! And who’re you, coming here and asking questions about all that? It’s over, innit. . . . It’s over. . . .”
He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin’s candle, extinguishing everything. . . .
Dumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around Harry’s arm and
they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light
in Dumbledore’s office seemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that impenetrable darkness.
“Is that all?” said Harry at once. “Why did it go dark, what happened?”
“Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point
onward,” said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat.
“When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite
alone. Marvolo’s ring had gone.
“Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies
lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and
his mother and father.
“The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware,
they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada
Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The
exception sits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to
Harry’s scar. “The Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that
this was a wizard’s murder. They also knew that a convicted Mugglehater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater
who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the
murdered people.
“So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to
question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to
the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could
know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been
awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand,
which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles.
And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight.
All that disturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had disappeared. ‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his captors over and over
again. ‘He’ll kill me for losing his ring.’ And that, apparently, was
all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last heirloom, and is buried
beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired
within its walls.”
“So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Harry, sitting up straight.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no memories to
show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened.
Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded
across the valley to ‘the big house over the way’ There he murdered
the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for
good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last
of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father
who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind, laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious
owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.”
“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful
confession.”
“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out
of him,” said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further
into Morfin’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime?
However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of
his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I
could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure
Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their
decision, however, Morfin had died.”
“But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that Voldemort had
done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked angrily. “He was underage at
the time, wasn’t he? I thought they could detect underage magic!”
“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry
for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by —”
“Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you’re
underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house,
the Ministry won’t know?”
“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,”
said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation
on Harry’s face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce
their offspring’s obedience while within their walls.”
“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what happened
here, look what happened to Morfin!”
“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he did not
deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory
before we part. . . .”
Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial
and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had
said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed
that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as
though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?
“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he had finally
emptied the phial. “We shall be back before you know it. Once
more into the Pensieve, then . . .”
And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time
right in front of a man he recognized at once.
It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to
him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny,
straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had
had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleonsized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it
was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as
the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly
embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a
comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of
wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple.
Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and
saw that they were standing in Slughorn’s office. Half a dozen boys
were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his,
and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once.
His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of
all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his
chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s goldand-black ring; he had already killed his father.
“Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” he asked.
“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining
the effect slightly by winking. “I must say, I’d like to know where
you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the
staff, you are.”
Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring
looks.
“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t,
and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for
the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite —”
As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened.
The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that
Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was
standing beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice rang out through the
mist, unnaturally loudly, “You’ll go wrong, boy, mark my words.”
The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody
made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything
unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a
small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven
o’clock.
“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn. “You’d
better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want
your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”
Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his
empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately,
wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.
“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turning around and finding
him still present. “You don’t want to be caught out of bed out of
hours, and you a prefect . . .”
“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.”
“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”
And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room
so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only
Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice
boomed out again, just as it had done before.
“I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t tell you if I
did! Now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you mentioning
them again!”
“Well, that’s that,” said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry.
“Time to go.”
And Harry’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the
rug in front of Dumbledore’s desk.
“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly.
Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory
of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed
it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened
except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an
answer.
“As you might have noticed,” said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, “that memory has been tampered with.”
“Tampered with?” repeated Harry, sitting back down too.
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Professor Slughorn has meddled
with his own recollections.”
“But why would he do that?”
“Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,” said
Dumbledore. “He has tried to rework the memory to show himself
in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me
to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is
all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.
“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It
will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real
memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.”
Harry stared at him.
“But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, “you don’t need me — you could use Legilimency . . . or
Veritaserum. . . .”
“Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished
at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever
since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
“No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth
from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm
than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has
his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one
person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, 
Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good
luck . . . and good night.”
A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet
quickly. “Good night, sir.”
As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard
Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy should be able to do
it better than you, Dumbledore.”
“I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied Dumbledore, and
Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.
