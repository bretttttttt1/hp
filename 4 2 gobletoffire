THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES

The next two days passed without great incident, unless you
counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Neville detention, and Neville returned
from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.
“You know why Snape’s in such a foul mood, don’t you?” said
Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Moody.”
It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark
Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers,
and shown it — but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt
animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the
two of them together — at mealtimes, or when they passed in the
corridors — he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody’s eye, whether magical or normal.
“I reckon Snape’s a bit scared of him, you know,” Harry said
thoughtfully.
“Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,” said Ron,
his eyes misting over, “and bounced him all around his dungeon. . . .”
The Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody’s
first lesson so much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime
and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung.
The only person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in
time for the lesson.
“Been in the —”
“Library.” Harry finished her sentence for her. “C’mon, quick,
or we won’t get decent seats.”
They hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher’s
desk, took out their copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to SelfProtection, and waited, unusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody’s
distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he
entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. They
could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes.
“You can put those away,” he growled, stumping over to his desk
and sitting down, “those books. You won’t need them.”
They returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.
Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray
hair out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out
names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each student as he or she
answered.
“Right then,” he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, “I’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this
class. Seems you’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling
Dark creatures — you’ve covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks,
grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right?”
There was a general murmur of assent.
“But you’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses,”
said Moody. “So I’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I’ve got one year to teach you how to deal
with Dark —”
“What, aren’t you staying?” Ron blurted out.
Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked
extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled — the
first time Harry had seen him do so. The effect was to make his
heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever, but
it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as
friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved.
“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said. “Your father
got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago. . . . Yeah, I’m staying just the one year. Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year,
and then back to my quiet retirement.”
He gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands
together.
“So — straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths
and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I’m supposed
to teach you countercurses and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to
show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you’re in the sixth
year. You’re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then.
But Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher opinion of your nerves,

  
he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what
you’re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend
yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about
to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about
to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need
to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put
that away, Miss Brown, when I’m talking.”
Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati
her completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s
magical eye could see through solid wood, as well as out of the back
of his head.
“So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law?”
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and
Hermione’s. Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was
still fixed on Lavender.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it
called the Imperius Curse, or something?”
“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father would know
that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk
drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him —
Ron hated spiders.
Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held
it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then
pointed his wand at it and muttered, “Imperio!”
The spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread of silk and
began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It
stretched out its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the
thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its
hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance.
Everyone was laughing — everyone except Moody.
“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would
you, if I did it to you?”
The laughter died away almost instantly.
“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up
and began to roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the
window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he
was talking about the days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being
forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you
how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s
got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT
VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back
into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight
surprise, did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology, which was easily his best
subject. Neville looked surprised at his own daring.

  
“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on
Neville.
“There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a small but
distinct voice.
Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both
eyes.
“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye swooping
down to check the register again.
Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar
for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move.
“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit bigger
for you to get the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider.
“Engorgio!”
The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away
from Moody’s desk as possible.
Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, “Crucio!”
At once, the spider’s legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and
began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came
from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it
would have been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and
the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently —
“Stop it!” Hermione said shrilly.
Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider,
but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville’s
hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles
white, his eyes wide and horrified.
Moody raised his wand. The spider’s legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch.
“Reducio,” Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its
proper size. He put it back into the jar.
“Pain,” said Moody softly. “You don’t need thumbscrews or
knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus
Curse. . . . That one was very popular once too.
“Right . . . anyone know any others?”
Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone’s faces, he
guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the
last spider. Hermione’s hand shook slightly as, for the third time,
she raised it into the air.
“Yes?” said Moody, looking at her.
“Avada Kedavra,” Hermione whispered.
Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.
“Ah,” said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided
mouth. “Yes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra . . . the Killing
Curse.”
He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew
what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the
bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody’s fingers, but he trapped
it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically
across the wooden surface.
Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of
foreboding.
“Avada Kedavra!” Moody roared.

  
There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as
though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air —
instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but
unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had
thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the
spider skidded toward him.
Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.
“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no
countercurse. There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has
ever survived it, and he’s sitting right in front of me.”
Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked
into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him
too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by
it, but not really seeing it at all. . . .
So that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider.
Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply
seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death,
before life was wiped from their bodies?
Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over
again for three years now, ever since he’d found out they had
been murdered, ever since he’d found out what had happened
that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’ whereabouts to
Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How
Voldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James Potter had
tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry
and run . . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to
move aside so that he could kill Harry . . . how she had begged
him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son . . . and so
Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on
Harry. . . .
Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents’
voices when he had fought the dementors last year — for that was
the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive
the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their
own despair. . . .
Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to
Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present
and listened to what Moody was saying.
“Avada Kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it — you could all get your wands out now and point them at
me and say the words, and I doubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed.
But that doesn’t matter. I’m not here to teach you how to do it.
“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because
you’ve got to know. You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You
don’t want to find yourself in a situation where you’re facing
it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole class
jumped again.
“Now . . . those three curses — Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and
Cruciatus — are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any
one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life
sentence in Azkaban. That’s what you’re up against. That’s what
I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing
vigilance. Get out your quills . . . copy this down. . . .”
They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang — but when

  
Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussing the curses in
awed voices — “Did you see it twitch?” “— and when he killed
it — just like that!”
They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it
had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn’t found it very
entertaining — and nor, it seemed, had Hermione.
“Hurry up,” she said tensely to Harry and Ron.
“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron.
“No,” said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. “Neville.”
Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the
stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he
had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.
“Neville?” Hermione said gently.
Neville looked around.
“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual. “Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m — I’m starving, aren’t you?”
“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.
“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high
voice. “Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what’s for
eating?”
Ron gave Harry a startled look.
“Neville, what — ?”
But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they
turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of
them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke,
it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.
“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville. “Why don’t you come
up to my office? Come on . . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .”
Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with
Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical
eye upon Harry.
“You all right, are you, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry, almost defiantly.
Moody’s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed
Harry. Then he said, “You’ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe,
but you’ve got to know. No point pretending . . . well . . . come on,
Longbottom, I’ve got some books that might interest you.”
Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but
they didn’t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow
himself to be steered away, one of Moody’s gnarled hands on his
shoulder.
“What was that about?” said Ron, watching Neville and Moody
turn the corner.
“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking pensive.
“Some lesson, though, eh?” said Ron to Harry as they set off for
the Great Hall. “Fred and George were right, weren’t they? He
really knows his stuff, Moody, doesn’t he? When he did Avada
Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right —”
But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry’s face and
didn’t speak again until they reached the Great Hall, when he said
he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney’s
predictions tonight, since they would take hours.
Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron’s conversation
during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library

  
again. Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and
Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner,
now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.
“Wouldn’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we’d seen the curses?” Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.
“Yeah, probably,” said Ron. “But Dumbledore’s always done
things his way, hasn’t he, and Moody’s been getting in trouble for
years, I reckon. Attacks first and asks questions later — look at his
dustbins. Balderdash.”
The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and
they climbed into the Gryffindor common room, which was
crowded and noisy.
“Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?” said Harry.
“I s’pose,” Ron groaned.
They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts,
to find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a
good deal calmer than at the end of Moody’s lesson, though still
not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.
“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.
“Oh yes,” said Neville, “I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book
Professor Moody lent me. . . .”
He held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.
“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really
good at Herbology,” Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in
his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before. “He thought I’d
like this.”
Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought,
had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very
rarely heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing
Professor Lupin would have done.
Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back
down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their
predictions for the coming month. An hour later, they had made
very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of
parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry’s brain was as
fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor
Trelawney’s fire.
“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to mean,” he said,
staring down at a long list of calculations.
“You know,” said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the
times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, “I think it’s
back to the old Divination standby.”
“What — make it up?”
“Yeah,” said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the
table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.
“Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to develop
a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.”
He looked up at Harry. “You know her — just put in loads of misery, she’ll lap it up.”
“Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing
it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire.
“Okay . . . on Monday, I will be in danger of — er — burns.”
“Yeah, you will be,” said Ron darkly, “we’re seeing the skrewts
again on Monday. Okay, Tuesday, I’ll . . . erm . . .”
“Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was flicking
through Unfogging the Future for ideas.
“Good one,” said Ron, copying it down. “Because of . . .

  
erm . . . Mercury. Why don’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend?”
“Yeah . . . cool . . .” said Harry, scribbling it down, “because . . .
Venus is in the twelfth house.”
“And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worst in a fight.”
“Aaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I’ll lose a bet.”
“Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight. . . .”
They continued to make up predictions (which grew steadily
more tragic) for another hour, while the common room around
them slowly emptied as people went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if she knew they
weren’t doing their homework properly.
Staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune
he hadn’t yet used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together
against the opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring over a
single piece of parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and
George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually
liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention.
There was something secretive about the way they were working on
the piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had
sat together writing something back at the Burrow. He had
thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys’ Wizard
Wheezes, but it didn’t look like that this time; if it had been, they
would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered
whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard
Tournament.
As Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched out
something with his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that never-
  
theless carried across the almost deserted room, “No — that sounds
like we’re accusing him. Got to be careful . . .”
Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry
grinned and quickly returned to his predictions — he didn’t want
George to think he was eavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins
rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.
Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room
carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other. Crookshanks arched his
back, purring.
“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!”
“So have I!” said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.
Hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an
empty armchair, and pulled Ron’s predictions toward her.
“Not going to have a very good month, are you?” she said sardonically as Crookshanks curled up in her lap.
“Ah well, at least I’m forewarned,” Ron yawned.
“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.
“Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions. “I’d better
change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.”
“Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these up?” said
Hermione.
“How dare you!” said Ron, in mock outrage. “We’ve been working like house-elves here!”
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“It’s just an expression,” said Ron hastily.
Harry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his
own death by decapitation.

  
“What’s in the box?” he asked, pointing at it.
“Funny you should ask,” said Hermione, with a nasty look at
Ron. She took off the lid and showed them the contents.
Inside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all
bearing the same letters: S.P.E.W.
“ ‘Spew’?” said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it.
“What’s this about?”
“Not spew,” said Hermione impatiently. “It’s S-P-E-W. Stands
for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.”
“Never heard of it,” said Ron.
“Well, of course you haven’t,” said Hermione briskly, “I’ve only
just started it.”
“Yeah?” said Ron in mild surprise. “How many members have
you got?”
“Well — if you two join — three,” said Hermione.
“And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying
‘spew,’ do you?” said Ron.
“S-P-E-W!” said Hermione hotly. “I was going to put Stop the
Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status — but it wouldn’t fit. So
that’s the heading of our manifesto.”
She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.
“I’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can’t believe no one’s done anything
about it before now.”
“Hermione — open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They. Like. It.
They like being enslaved!”
“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more
loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn’t heard a word, “are
to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our longterm aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying
to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of
Magical Creatures, because they’re shockingly underrepresented.”
“And how do we do all this?” Harry asked.
“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione happily. “I
thought two Sickles to join — that buys a badge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign. You’re treasurer, Ron — I’ve
got you a collecting tin upstairs — and Harry, you’re secretary, so
you might want to write down everything I’m saying now, as a
record of our first meeting.”
There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of
them, and Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and
amusement at the look on Ron’s face. The silence was broken, not
by Ron, who in any case looked as though he was temporarily
dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window. Harry looked
across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the
moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.
“Hedwig!” he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair
and across the room to pull open the window.
Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the
table on top of Harry’s predictions.
“About time!” said Harry, hurrying after her.
“She’s got an answer!” said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby
piece of parchment tied to Hedwig’s leg.
Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly.

  
“What does it say?” Hermione asked breathlessly.
The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been
scrawled in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud:
Harry —
I’m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is
the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me
here. If it hurts again, go straight to Dumbledore — they’re
saying he’s got Mad-Eye out of retirement, which means he’s
reading the signs, even if no one else is.
I’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep
your eyes open, Harry.
Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him.
“He’s flying north?” Hermione whispered. “He’s coming back?”
“Dumbledore’s reading what signs?” said Ron, looking perplexed. “Harry — what’s up?”
For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap.
“I shouldn’t’ve told him!” Harry said furiously.
“What are you on about?” said Ron in surprise.
“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said Harry, now
slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back
of Ron’s chair, hooting indignantly. “Coming back, because he
thinks I’m in trouble! And there’s nothing wrong with me! And I
haven’t got anything for you,” Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was
clicking her beak expectantly, “you’ll have to go up to the Owlery
if you want food.”
Hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for
the open window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.
“Harry,” Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.
“I’m going to bed,” said Harry shortly. “See you in the
morning.”
Upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into
his four-poster, but he didn’t feel remotely tired.
If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry’s,
fault. Why hadn’t he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds’ pain and
he’d had to blab. . . . If he’d just had the sense to keep it to
himself. . . .
He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later,
but did not speak to him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at
the dark canopy of his bed. The dormitory was completely silent,
and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that
the absence of Neville’s usual snores meant that he was not the only
one lying awake.

C H A P T E R F I F T E E N

BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG

Early next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his
mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all
night. He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory
without waking Ron, and went back down to the deserted common
room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which
his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter:
Dear Sirius,
I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep
when I wrote to you last time. There’s no point coming back,
everything’s fine here. Don’t worry about me, my head feels
completely normal.
He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent
castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large
vase on him halfway along the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower.
The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty,
because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was
entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated
skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of
every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right
up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here
and there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig
nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her,
sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor.
It took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look
at him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her
tail. She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the
previous night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too
tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon,
that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it.
“Just find him, all right?” Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. “Before the dementors do.”
She nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all
the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise.
Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius’s reply
would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.
“That was a lie, Harry,” said Hermione sharply over breakfast,
when he told her and Ron what he had done. “You didn’t imagine
your scar hurting and you know it.”
“So what?” said Harry. “He’s not going back to Azkaban because
of me.”
“Drop it,” said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her
mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him,
and fell silent.
Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late
at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his
godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more
difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody’s
Defense Against the Dark Arts.
To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he
would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to
demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects.
“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his
wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. “You
said — to use it against another human was —”
“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody,
his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an
eerie, unblinking stare. “If you’d rather learn the hard way — when
someone’s putting it on you so they can control you completely —
fine by me. You’re excused. Off you go.”
He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went
very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she
wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew
Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.
Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the
Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his
classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence.
Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the
national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly
not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them
seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered
only when Moody had removed it.
“Potter,” Moody growled, “you next.”
Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the
space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand,
pointed it at Harry, and said, “Imperio!”
It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation
as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away,
leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there
feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching
him.
And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in some
distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk . . . jump
onto the desk. . . .
Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.
Jump onto the desk. . . .
Why, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain.

  
Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice.
Jump onto the desk. . . .
No, I don’t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more
firmly . . . no, I don’t really want to. . . .
Jump! NOW !
The next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both
jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping — the result
was that he’d smashed headlong into the desk, knocking it over,
and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.
“Now, that’s more like it!” growled Moody’s voice, and suddenly,
Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear. He remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees
seemed to double.
“Look at that, you lot . . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he
damn near beat it! We’ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you,
pay attention — watch his eyes, that’s where you see it — very
good, Potter, very good indeed! They’ll have trouble controlling
you!”
“The way he talks,” Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted
on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row, until
Harry could throw off the curse entirely), “you’d think we were all
going to be attacked any second.”
“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate
step. He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry,
though Moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about paranoid . . .” Ron glanced nervously over his
shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and
went on. “No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch
who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are
we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we’ve got to do?”
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the
amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor
McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud
groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had
assigned.
“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical
education!” she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind
her square spectacles. “Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —”
“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean Thomas
indignantly.
“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class
who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls
up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!”
Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself.
Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney
told them that they had received top marks for their homework in
their next Divination class. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of

  
the horrors in store for them — but they were less amused when
she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both
of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes.
Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of
Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of
the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that
he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their
antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three
extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.
Even Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended
Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had
yet discovered what they ate. Hagrid was delighted, and as part of
their “project,” suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior.
“I will not,” said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed
this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out
of his sack. “I see enough of these foul things during lessons,
thanks.”
Hagrid’s smile faded off his face.
“Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told,” he growled, “or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta
Professor Moody’s book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”
The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with
anger, but apparently the memory of Moody’s punishment was still
sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high
spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying,
BEAUXBATONS AND
DURMSTRANG
  
especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid
sacked the previous year.
When they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves
unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large sign that had been erected at
the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three, stood
on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign
aloud to the other two:
TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
The delegations from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang will be arriving at 6 o’clock
on Friday the 30th of October. Lessons will
end half an hour early —
“Brilliant!” said Harry. “It’s Potions last thing on Friday! Snape
won’t have time to poison us all!”
Students will return their bags and books
to their dormitories and assemble in front
of the castle to greet our guests before
the Welcoming Feast.
“Only a week away!” said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff, emerging from the crowd, his eyes gleaming. “I wonder if Cedric knows?
Think I’ll go and tell him. . . .”
“Cedric?” said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.
“Diggory,” said Harry. “He must be entering the tournament.”

  
“That idiot, Hogwarts champion?” said Ron as they pushed
their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase.
“He’s not an idiot. You just don’t like him because he beat
Gryffindor at Quidditch,” said Hermione. “I’ve heard he’s a really
good student — and he’s a prefect.”
She spoke as though this settled the matter.
“You only like him because he’s handsome,” said Ron scathingly.
“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!”
said Hermione indignantly.
Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like
“Lockhart!”
The appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week,
there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where
Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament. Rumors were flying from
student to student like highly contagious germs: who was going to
try for Hogwarts champion, what the tournament would involve,
how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from
themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an
extra-thorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been
scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their
raw pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and
moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their
shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.
Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.
“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even perform a
  
simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult
lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own
ears onto a cactus.
When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each
of them representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion for
Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a
black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for
Slytherin. Behind the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore
the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united
around a large letter H.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at
the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were
sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices. Ron
led the way over to them.
“It’s a bummer, all right,” George was saying gloomily to Fred.
“But if he won’t talk to us in person, we’ll have to send him the
letter after all. Or we’ll stuff it into his hand. He can’t avoid us
forever.”
“Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down next to them.
“Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption.
“What’s a bummer?” Ron asked George.
“Having a nosy git like you for a brother,” said George.
“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?”
Harry asked. “Thought any more about trying to enter?”
“I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she

  
wasn’t telling,” said George bitterly. “She just told me to shut up
and get on with transfiguring my raccoon.”
“Wonder what the tasks are going to be?” said Ron thoughtfully.
“You know, I bet we could do them, Harry. We’ve done dangerous
stuff before. . . .”
“Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t,” said Fred.
“McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to
how well they’ve done the tasks.”
“Who are the judges?” Harry asked.
“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the
panel,” said Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather
surprised, “because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed
to be catching went on the rampage.”
She noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air
of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had, “It’s
all in Hogwarts, A History. Though, of course, that book’s not entirely reliable. A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title. Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts,
Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School.”
“What are you on about?” said Ron, though Harry thought he
knew what was coming.
“House-elves!” said Hermione, her eyes flashing. “Not once, in
over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A History mention that we are
all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves!”
Harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs.
His and Ron’s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to
curb Hermione’s determination to pursue justice for house-elves.
  
True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but
they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been
wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione
more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since,
first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and
she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room
every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.
“You do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your
classrooms cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical
creatures who are unpaid and enslaved?” she kept saying fiercely.
Some people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione
from glowering at them. A few seemed mildly interested in what
she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.
Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them
all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his
bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George,
however, leaned in toward Hermione.
“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?”
“No, of course not,” said Hermione curtly, “I hardly think students are supposed to —”
“Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads of times,
to nick food. And we’ve met them, and they’re happy. They think
they’ve got the best job in the world —”
“That’s because they’re uneducated and brainwashed!” Hermione began hotly, but her next few words were drowned out by the
sudden whooshing noise from overhead, which announced the

  
arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig
soaring toward him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and
Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry’s
shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.
Harry pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig his bacon
rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and
George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius’s letter in a whisper to
Ron and Hermione.
Nice try, Harry.
I’m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep
me posted on everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. Don’t use
Hedwig, keep changing owls, and don’t worry about me, just
watch out for yourself. Don’t forget what I said about your scar.
“Why d’you have to keep changing owls?” Ron asked in a low
voice.
“Hedwig’ll attract too much attention,” said Hermione at once.
“She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s
hiding . . . I mean, they’re not native birds, are they?”
Harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get back without being caught was
something. He couldn’t deny either that the idea that Sirius was
much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn’t have to wait so
long for a response every time he wrote.
“Thanks, Hedwig,” he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily,
  
dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took
off again, clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the Owlery.
There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day.
Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested
in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was
half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags
and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and
rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.
The Heads of Houses were ordering their students into lines.
“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor McGonagall snapped
at Ron. “Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.”
Parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from
the end of her plait.
“Follow me, please,” said Professor McGonagall. “First years in
front . . . no pushing. . . .”
They filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle. It
was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparentlooking moon was already shining over the Forbidden Forest.
Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row
from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years.
“Nearly six,” said Ron, checking his watch and then staring
down the drive that led to the front gates. “How d’you reckon
they’re coming? The train?”
“I doubt it,” said Hermione.
“How, then? Broomsticks?” Harry suggested, looking up at the
starry sky.

  
“I don’t think so . . . not from that far away. . . .”
“A Portkey?” Ron suggested. “Or they could Apparate — maybe
you’re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from?”
“You can’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do
I have to tell you?” said Hermione impatiently.
They scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was
moving; everything was still, silent, and quite as usual. Harry was
starting to feel cold. He wished they’d hurry up. . . . Maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance. . . . He remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the campsite before the
Quidditch World Cup: “always the same — we can’t resist showing
off when we get together. . . .”
And then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he
stood with the other teachers —
“Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from
Beauxbatons approaches!”
“Where?” said many students eagerly, all looking in different
directions.
“There!” yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest.
Something large, much larger than a broomstick — or, indeed,
a hundred broomsticks — was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time.
“It’s a dragon!” shrieked one of the first years, losing her head
completely.
“Don’t be stupid . . . it’s a flying house!” said Dennis Creevey.
Dennis’s guess was closer. . . . As the gigantic black shape
skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights
shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powderblue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward
  
them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant.
The front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage
hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed —
then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward
onto a Slytherin fifth year’s foot, the horses’ hooves, larger than
dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed
too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed
their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes.
Harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a
coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars)
before it opened.
A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent
forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage
floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging
from the inside of the carriage — a shoe the size of a child’s sled —
followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever
seen in his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped.
Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in
his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an
inch difference in their heights. Yet somehow — maybe simply
because he was used to Hagrid — this woman (now at the foot of
the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd)
seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light
flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a
rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at

  
the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black
satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on
her thick fingers.
Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead,
broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.
Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward
toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore,
though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it.
“My dear Madame Maxime,” he said. “Welcome to Hogwarts.”
“Dumbly-dorr,” said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. “I ’ope I
find you well?”
“In excellent form, I thank you,” said Dumbledore.
“My pupils,” said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her.
Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon
Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls,
all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the
carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. They
were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes
seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing
cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads.
From what Harry could see of them (they were standing in Madame
Maxime’s enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts
with apprehensive looks on their faces.
“ ’As Karkaroff arrived yet?” Madame Maxime asked.
“He should be here any moment,” said Dumbledore. “Would
you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?”
“Warm up, I think,” said Madame Maxime. “But ze ’orses —”
“Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take
care of them,” said Dumbledore, “the moment he has returned
from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his
other — er — charges.”
“Skrewts,” Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.
“My steeds require — er — forceful ’andling,” said Madame
Maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts could be up to the job. “Zey are
very strong. . . .”
“I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
“Very well,” said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. “Will you
please inform zis ’Agrid zat ze ’orses drink only single-malt whiskey?”
“It will be attended to,” said Dumbledore, also bowing.
“Come,” said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students,
and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to
pass up the stone steps.
“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going to be?”
Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.
“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won’t be
able to handle them,” said Harry. “That’s if he hasn’t been attacked
by his skrewts. Wonder what’s up with them?”
“Maybe they’ve escaped,” said Ron hopefully.
“Oh don’t say that,” said Hermione with a shudder. “Imagine
that lot loose on the grounds. . . .”
They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang
party to arrive. Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky.

  
For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame
Maxime’s huge horses snorting and stamping. But then —
“Can you hear something?” said Ron suddenly.
Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward
them from out of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking
sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along
a riverbed. . . .
“The lake!” yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. “Look at the
lake!”
From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the
grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the
water — except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all.
Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the
muddy banks — and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a
whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of
the lake’s floor. . . .
What seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of
the heart of the whirlpool . . . and then Harry saw the rigging. . . .
“It’s a mast!” he said to Ron and Hermione.
Slowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in
the moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though
it were a resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering
at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the turbulent
water, and began to glide toward the bank. A few moments later,
they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank.
People were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes
passing the lights in the ship’s portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle . . .
but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light
streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really
due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy,
matted fur. But the man who was leading them up to the castle was
wearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like his hair.
“Dumbledore!” he called heartily as he walked up the slope.
“How are you, my dear fellow, how are you?”
“Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,” Dumbledore replied.
Karkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the
light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he
was tall and thin like Dumbledore, but his white hair was short,
and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide his
rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore, he shook hands
with both of his own.
“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile
did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd. “How
good it is to be here, how good. . . . Viktor, come along, into the
warmth . . . you don’t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a slight head
cold. . . .”
Karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy
passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and
thick black eyebrows. He didn’t need the punch on the arm Ron
gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.
“Harry — it’s Krum!”

THE GOBLET OF FIRE

I don’t believe it!” Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts
students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. “Krum, Harry! Viktor Krum!”
“For heaven’s sake, Ron, he’s only a Quidditch player,” said
Hermione.
“Only a Quidditch player?” Ron said, looking at her as though he
couldn’t believe his ears. “Hermione — he’s one of the best Seekers
in the world! I had no idea he was still at school!”
As they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts
students heading for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the
back of Krum’s head. Several sixth-year girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked —
“Oh I don’t believe it, I haven’t got a single quill on me —”
“D’you think he’d sign my hat in lipstick?”
“Really,” Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now
squabbling over the lipstick.
“I’m getting his autograph if I can,” said Ron. “You haven’t got a
quill, have you, Harry?”
“Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag,” said Harry.
They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down. Ron
took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because Krum and
his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit. The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They were looking
around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces. Three
of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.
“It’s not that cold,” said Hermione defensively. “Why didn’t they
bring cloaks?”
“Over here! Come and sit over here!” Ron hissed. “Over here!
Hermione, budge up, make a space —”
“What?”
“Too late,” said Ron bitterly.
Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled
themselves at the Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe,
and Goyle looking very smug about this. As he watched, Malfoy
bent forward to speak to Krum.
“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,” said Ron
scathingly. “I bet Krum can see right through him, though . . . bet
he gets people fawning over him all the time. . . . Where d’you
reckon they’re going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our
dormitory, Harry . . . I wouldn’t mind giving him my bed, I could
kip on a camp bed.”
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
  
Hermione snorted.
“They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,” said Harry.
The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and
looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a
couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and
examining them, apparently impressed.
Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He
was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry
was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of
Dumbledore’s.
“But there are only two extra people,” Harry said. “Why’s Filch
putting out four chairs, who else is coming?”
“Eh?” said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.
When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at
their House tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and
taking their seats. Last in line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet. A few of
the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared
quite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore’s left-hand side.
Dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great
Hall.
“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and — most particularly — guests,” said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign
students. “I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I
hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and
enjoyable.”

  
One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her
head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh.
“No one’s making you stay!” Hermione whispered, bristling at
her.
“The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the
feast,” said Dumbledore. “I now invite you all to eat, drink, and
make yourselves at home!”
He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and
engage him in conversation.
The plates in front of them filled with food as usual. The houseelves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there
was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever
seen, including several that were definitely foreign.
“What’s that?” said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of
shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.
“Bouillabaisse,” said Hermione.
“Bless you,” said Ron.
“It’s French,” said Hermione, “I had it on holiday summer before
last. It’s very nice.”
“I’ll take your word for it,” said Ron, helping himself to black
pudding.
The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than
usual, even though there were barely twenty additional students
there; perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms
stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts’ robes. Now
that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred.
Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table

  
twenty minutes after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at
the end and waved at Harry, Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.
“Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?” Harry called.
“Thrivin’,” Hagrid called back happily.
“Yeah, I’ll just bet they are,” said Ron quietly. “Looks like they’ve
finally found a food they like, doesn’t it? Hagrid’s fingers.”
At that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you wanting ze
bouillabaisse?”
It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore’s speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet
of silvery-blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep
blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.
Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.
“Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.
“You ’ave finished wiz it?”
“Yeah,” Ron said breathlessly. “Yeah, it was excellent.”
The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the
Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had
never seen one before. Harry started to laugh. The sound seemed
to jog Ron back to his senses.
“She’s a veela!” he said hoarsely to Harry.
“Of course she isn’t!” said Hermione tartly. “I don’t see anyone
else gaping at her like an idiot!”
But she wasn’t entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the
Hall, many boys’ heads turned, and some of them seemed to have
become temporarily speechless, just like Ron.
“I’m telling you, that’s not a normal girl!” said Ron, leaning

  
sideways so he could keep a clear view of her. “They don’t make
them like that at Hogwarts!”
“They make them okay at Hogwarts,” said Harry without thinking. Cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the
girl with the silvery hair.
“When you’ve both put your eyes back in,” said Hermione
briskly, “you’ll be able to see who’s just arrived.”
She was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty
seats had just been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff’s other side, while Mr. Crouch, Percy’s boss, was next
to Madame Maxime.
“What are they doing here?” said Harry in surprise.
“They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn’t they?” said
Hermione. “I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.”
When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too. Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange
closely, then moved it carefully a few inches to his right, so that it
would be clearly visible from the Ravenclaw table. The girl who
looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough, however, and
did not come over to get it.
Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore
stood up again. A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall
now. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was
coming. Several seats down from them, Fred and George were
leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration.
“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling around at
the sea of upturned faces. “The Triwizard Tournament is about to
start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring
in the casket —”

  
“The what?” Harry muttered.
Ron shrugged.
“— just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this
year. But first, let me introduce, for those who do not know them,
Mr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International
Magical Cooperation” — there was a smattering of polite applause — “and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of
Magical Games and Sports.”
There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than
for Crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much more likable. He acknowledged it with a
jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave
when his name was announced. Remembering him in his neat suit
at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in
wizard’s robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked
very odd next to Dumbledore’s long white hair and beard.
“Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the
last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “and they will be joining myself,
Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the panel that will
judge the champions’ efforts.”
At the mention of the word “champions,” the attentiveness of
the listening students seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had
noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, “The casket,
then, if you please, Mr. Filch.”
Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the
Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest
encrusted with jewels. It looked extremely old. A murmur of
excited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey

  
actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his
head hardly rose above anyone else’s.
“The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year
have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,” said
Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before
him, “and they have made the necessary arrangements for each
challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school
year, and they will test the champions in many different ways . . .
their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction — and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.”
At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute
that nobody seemed to be breathing.
“As you know, three champions compete in the tournament,”
Dumbledore went on calmly, “one from each of the participating
schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the
Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after
task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.”
Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times
upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden
cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full
to the brim with dancing blue-white flames.
Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on
top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.
“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write
their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it
into the goblet,” said Dumbledore. “Aspiring champions have
twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow

  
night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of the three it
has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will
be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete.
“To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,” said
Dumbledore, “I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of
Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the
age of seventeen will be able to cross this line.
“Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete
that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to
see the tournament through to the end. The placing of your name
in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be
no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be
very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play
before you drop your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is time
for bed. Good night to you all.”
“An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all
made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall.
“Well, that should be fooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn’t it? And
once your name’s in that goblet, you’re laughing — it can’t tell
whether you’re seventeen or not!”
“But I don’t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,”
said Hermione, “we just haven’t learned enough . . .”
“Speak for yourself,” said George shortly. “You’ll try and get in,
won’t you, Harry?”
Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore’s insistence that nobody
under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled his

  
mind again. . . . He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if
someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age
Line. . . .
“Where is he?” said Ron, who wasn’t listening to a word of this
conversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum. “Dumbledore didn’t say where the Durmstrang
people are sleeping, did he?”
But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level
with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to
his students.
“Back to the ship, then,” he was saying. “Viktor, how are you
feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine
from the kitchens?”
Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on.
“Professor, I vood like some vine,” said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully.
“I wasn’t offering it to you, Poliakoff,” snapped Karkaroff, his
warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant. “I notice you have
dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting
boy —”
Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching
them at exactly the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
Harry stopped to let him walk through first.
“Thank you,” said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him.
And then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry and
stared at him as though he couldn’t believe his eyes. Behind their
headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a halt too.
Karkaroff’s eyes moved slowly up Harry’s face and fixed upon his
scar. The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too.

  
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a
few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the
girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry’s forehead.
“Yeah, that’s Harry Potter,” said a growling voice from behind
them.
Professor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing
there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster.
The color drained from Karkaroff’s face as Harry watched. A
terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him.
“You!” he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really
seeing him.
“Me,” said Moody grimly. “And unless you’ve got anything to
say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want to move. You’re blocking
the doorway.”
It was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking over one another’s shoulders to see what was
causing the holdup.
Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students
away with him. Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his
magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his
mutilated face.
As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have
breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not
alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends.
When they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about
twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the

  
hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden
line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around
it in every direction.
“Anyone put their name in yet?” Ron asked a third-year girl
eagerly.
“All the Durmstrang lot,” she replied. “But I haven’t seen anyone
from Hogwarts yet.”
“Bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all gone to bed,”
said Harry. “I would’ve if it had been me . . . wouldn’t have wanted
everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back
out again?”
Someone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George,
and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.
“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and
Hermione. “Just taken it.”
“What?” said Ron.
“The Aging Potion, dung brains,” said Fred.
“One drop each,” said George, rubbing his hands together with
glee. “We only need to be a few months older.”
“We’re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of
us if one of us wins,” said Lee, grinning broadly.
“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said Hermione
warningly “I’m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.”
Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.
“Ready?” Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement.
“C’mon, then — I’ll go first —”
Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment
out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley — Hogwarts. Fred

  
walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on
his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with the
eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great
breath and stepped over the line.
For a split second Harry thought it had worked — George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after
Fred — but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and
both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had
been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed painfully, ten
feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there
was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical
long white beards.
The entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George
joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look
at each other’s beards.
“I did warn you,” said a deep, amused voice, and everyone
turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall.
He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. “I suggest you
both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of
whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I must say,
neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.”
Fred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by
Lee, who was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and
Hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast.
The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning.
As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the
enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from

  
every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who
were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who
might be entering.
“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and
put his name in,” Dean told Harry. “That big bloke from Slytherin
who looks like a sloth.”
Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his
head in disgust.
“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”
“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,” said Seamus
contemptuously. “But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to
risk his good looks.”
“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly.
People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled
around in their seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the
Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who
played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came
over to them, sat down, and said, “Well, I’ve done it! Just put my
name in!”
“You’re kidding!” said Ron, looking impressed.
“Are you seventeen, then?” asked Harry.
“ ’Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you?” said Ron.
“I had my birthday last week,” said Angelina.
“Well, I’m glad someone from Gryffindor’s entering,” said
Hermione. “I really hope you get it, Angelina!”
“Thanks, Hermione,” said Angelina, smiling at her.
“Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory,” said Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.

  
“What’re we going to do today, then?” Ron asked Harry and
Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the
Great Hall.
“We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet,” said Harry.
“Okay,” said Ron, “just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a
few fingers to the skrewts.”
A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione’s
face.
“I’ve just realized — I haven’t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W.
yet!” she said brightly. “Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs
and get the badges?”
“What is it with her?” said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran
away up the marble staircase.
“Hey, Ron,” said Harry suddenly. “It’s your friend . . .”
The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front
doors from the grounds, among them, the veela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.
Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students
stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment
into the blue-white flames. As each name entered the fire, it turned
briefly red and emitted sparks.
“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t chosen?”
Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment
into the Goblet of Fire. “Reckon they’ll go back to school, or hang
around to watch the tournament?”
“Dunno,” said Harry. “Hang around, I suppose. . . . Madame
Maxime’s staying to judge, isn’t she?”

  
When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names,
Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the
grounds again.
“Where are they sleeping, then?” said Ron, moving toward the
front doors and staring after them.
A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione’s reappearance with the box of S.P.E.W. badges.
“Oh good, hurry up,” said Ron, and he jumped down the stone
steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now
halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime.
As they neared Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons’ sleeping quarters was solved.
The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had
been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid’s front door, and the
students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying
horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift
paddock alongside it.
Harry knocked on Hagrid’s door, and Fang’s booming barks answered instantly
“ ’Bout time!” said Hagrid, when he’d flung open the door.
“Thought you lot’d forgotten where I live!”
“We’ve been really busy, Hag —” Hermione started to say, but
then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for
words.
Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown
suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn’t the worst of
it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large
quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked
down into two bunches — perhaps he had tried a ponytail like

  
Bill’s, but found he had too much hair. The look didn’t really suit
Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, “Erm — where are the
skrewts?”
“Out by the pumpkin patch,” said Hagrid happily. “They’re gettin’ massive, mus’ be nearly three foot long now. On’y trouble is,
they’ve started killin’ each other.”
“Oh no, really?” said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at
Ron, who, staring at Hagrid’s odd hairstyle, had just opened his
mouth to say something about it.
“Yeah,” said Hagrid sadly. “ ’S’ okay, though, I’ve got ’em in separate boxes now. Still got abou’ twenty.”
“Well, that’s lucky,” said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.
Hagrid’s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which
was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the
quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling.
They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and
were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.
“You wait,” he said, grinning. “You jus’ wait. Yer going ter see
some stuff yeh’ve never seen before. Firs’ task . . . ah, but I’m not
supposed ter say.”
“Go on, Hagrid!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he
just shook his head, grinning.
“I don’ want ter spoil it fer yeh,” said Hagrid. “But it’s gonna be
spectacular, I’ll tell yeh that. Them champions’re going ter have
their work cut out. Never thought I’d live ter see the Triwizard
Tournament played again!”

  
They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn’t
eat much — Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole,
but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and
Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves
trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament
were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely
to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and
George were beardless yet.
A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy
sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the
window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves — for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W.
when she showed him her badges.
“It’d be doin’ ’em an unkindness, Hermione,” he said gravely,
threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. “It’s in
their nature ter look after humans, that’s what they like, see? Yeh’d
be makin’ ’em unhappy ter take away their work, an’ insultin’ ’em
if yeh tried ter pay ’em.”
“But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!”
said Hermione. “And we heard he’s asking for wages now!”
“Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I’m not sayin’ there
isn’t the odd elf who’d take freedom, but yeh’ll never persuade most
of ’em ter do it — no, nothin’ doin’, Hermione.”
Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of
badges back into her cloak pocket.
By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and
Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the
Halloween feast — and, more important, the announcement of
the school champions.

  
“I’ll come with yeh,” said Hagrid, putting away his darning.
“Jus’ give us a sec.”
Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his
bed, and began searching for something inside it. They didn’t pay
too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, “Hagrid, what’s that?”
“Eh?” said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his
hand. “Don’ yeh like it?”
“Is that aftershave?” said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.
“Er — eau de cologne,” Hagrid muttered. He was blushing.
“Maybe it’s a bit much,” he said gruffly. “I’ll go take it off, hang
on . . .
He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself
vigorously in the water barrel outside the window.
“Eau de cologne?” said Hermione in amazement. “Hagrid?”
“And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said Harry in an
undertone.
“Look!” said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window.
Hagrid had just straightened up and turned ’round. If he had
been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now.
Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn’t spot
them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and
saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just
emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast
too. They couldn’t hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking
to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had
only ever seen him wear once before — when he had been looking
at the baby dragon, Norbert.

  
“He’s going up to the castle with her!” said Hermione indignantly. “I thought he was waiting for us!”
Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was
trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with
their enormous strides.
“He fancies her!” said Ron incredulously. “Well, if they end up
having children, they’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby
of theirs would weigh about a ton.”
They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind
them. It was surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more
closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.
“Ooh it’s them, look!” Hermione whispered.
The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from
the lake. Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and
the other Durmstrang students were straggling along behind them.
Ron watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look around as he
reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione, Ron, and Harry
and proceeded through them.
When they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full.
The Goblet of Fire had been moved; it was now standing in front
of Dumbledore’s empty chair at the teachers’ table. Fred and
George — clean-shaven again — seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well.
“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
down.
“So do I!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Well, we’ll soon know!”
The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual.

  
Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn’t
seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would
have normally. Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the
fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to
hear who had been selected as champions.
At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless
state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the
Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his
feet. On either side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame
Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone. Ludo Bagman
was beaming and winking at various students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.
“Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,” said Dumbledore. “I estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when
the champions’ names are called, I would ask them please to come
up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through
into the next chamber” — he indicated the door behind the staff
table — “where they will be receiving their first instructions.”
He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at
once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were
extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The
Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the
whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting. . . . A few
people kept checking their watches. . . .
“Any second,” Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from
Harry.

  
The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks
began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the
air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it — the whole
room gasped.
Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm’s
length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had
turned back to blue-white.
“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear
voice, “will be Viktor Krum.”
“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and
cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the
Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned
right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the
door into the next chamber.
“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone
could hear him, even over all the applause. “Knew you had it in
you!
The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s attention
was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red
once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled
by the flames.
“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur
Delacour!”
“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a
veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery
blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff
tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the
noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party.

  
“Disappointed” was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought.
Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears
and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber,
silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered
out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip
Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the
uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff
had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric
made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward
the chamber behind the teachers’ table. Indeed, the applause for
Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore
could make himself heard again.
“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult
died down. “Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I
can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from
Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every
ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on,
you will contribute in a very real —”
But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him.
The fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne
upon it was another piece of parchment.
Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand

  
and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name
written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared
at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read
out —
“Harry Potter.”

C H A P T E R S E V E N T E E N
THE FOUR CHAMPION S

Harry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had
turned to look at him. He was stunned. He felt numb.
He was surely dreaming. He had not heard correctly.
There was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was
starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a
better look at Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat.
Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet
and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper
urgently to Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her,
frowning slightly.
Harry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the
long Gryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed.
“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry said blankly. “You know I
didn’t.”
Both of them stared just as blankly back.
H
THE FOUR CHAMPIONS
  
At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up,
nodding to Professor McGonagall.
“Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you please!”
“Go on,” Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.
Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled
slightly. He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn’t
seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and
hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight. The
buzzing grew louder and louder. After what seemed like an hour,
he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the
teachers upon him.
“Well . . . through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He wasn’t
smiling.
Harry moved off along the teachers’ table. Hagrid was seated
right at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of
his usual signs of greeting. He looked completely astonished and
stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else. Harry went through
the door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a smaller
room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A handsome
fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.
The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered.
He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into
the one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started whispering in his ear.
Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped
around the fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted
against the flames. Krum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning

  
against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric
was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire.
Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw
back her sheet of long, silvery hair.
“What is it?” she said. “Do zey want us back in ze Hall?”
She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn’t
know how to explain what had just happened. He just stood there,
looking at the three champions. It struck him how very tall all of
them were.
There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him
forward.
“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm. “Absolutely
extraordinary! Gentlemen . . . lady,” he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three. “May I introduce — incredible
though it may seem — the fourth Triwizard champion?”
Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman
to Harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard
what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair,
smiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester Bagman.”
“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at all!
Harry’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!”
Krum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely bewildered. Fleur frowned.
“But evidently zair ’as been a mistake,” she said contemptuously
to Bagman. “ ’E cannot compete. ’E is too young.”
“Well . . . it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin
and smiling down at Harry. “But, as you know, the age restriction

  
was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his
name’s come out of the goblet . . . I mean, I don’t think there can
be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It’s down in the rules, you’re
obliged . . . Harry will just have to do the best he —”
The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr.
Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor
McGonagall closed the door.
“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to her
headmistress. “Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!”
Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of
anger. Little boy?
Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candlefilled chandelier, and her gigantic black-satin bosom swelled.
“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” she said imperiously.
“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were
like chips of ice. “Two Hogwarts champions? I don’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions — or
have I not read the rules carefully enough?”
He gave a short and nasty laugh.
“C’est impossible,” said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand
with its many superb opals was resting upon Fleur’s shoulder.
“ ’Ogwarts cannot ’ave two champions. It is most injust.”
“We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep
out younger contestants, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, his steely

  
smile still in place, though his eyes were colder than ever. “Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of
candidates from our own schools.”
“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” said Snape softly. His
black eyes were alight with malice. “Don’t go blaming Dumbledore
for Potter’s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines
ever since he arrived here —”
“Thank you, Severus,” said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went
quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain
of greasy black hair.
Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who
looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the
eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.
“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” he
asked calmly.
“No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him
closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the
shadows.
“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire
for you?” said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.
“No,” said Harry vehemently.
“Ah, but of course ’e is lying!” cried Madame Maxime. Snape
was now shaking his head, his lip curling.
“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “I am sure we are all agreed on that —”
“Dumbly-dorr must ’ave made a mistake wiz ze line,” said
Madame Maxime, shrugging.
“It is possible, of course,” said Dumbledore politely
“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a

  
mistake!” said Professor McGonagall angrily. “Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student
to do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else!”
She shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.
“Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Bagman,” said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, “you are our — er — objective judges. Surely you
will agree that this is most irregular?”
Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and
looked at Mr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the
firelight, his face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie,
the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his
usual curt voice.
“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those
people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to
compete in the tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman,
beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as
though the matter was now closed.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” said Karkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his
smile now. His face wore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up
the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue adding names
until each school has two champions. It’s only fair, Dumbledore.”
“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman. “The
Goblet of Fire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of
the next tournament —”

  
“— in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations
and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to
occur! I have half a mind to leave now!”
“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door.
“You can’t leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve
all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore
said. Convenient, eh?”
Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire,
and with every right step he took, there was a loud clunk.
“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand
you, Moody.”
Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though
what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands
gave him away; they had balled themselves into fists.
“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff.
Someone put Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to
compete if it came out.”
“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two bites at ze
apple!” said Madame Maxime.
“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her.
“I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the
International Confederation of Wizards —”
“If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter,” growled Moody,
“but . . . funny thing . . . I don’t hear him saying a word. . . .”
“Why should ’e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping
her foot. “ ’E ’as ze chance to compete, ’asn’t ’e? We ’ave all been
’oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools!

  
A thousand Galleons in prize money — zis is a chance many would
die for!”
“Maybe someone’s hoping Potter is going to die for it,” said
Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.
An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman,
who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and
down on his feet and said, “Moody, old man . . . what a thing to
say!”
“We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if
he hasn’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,”
said Karkaroff loudly. “Apparently he is now teaching his students
to fear assassination too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your
reasons.”
“Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody. “Seeing things, eh?
It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy’s name in that
goblet. . . .”
“Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.
“Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!” said
Moody. “It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus
Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three
schools compete in the tournament. . . . I’m guessing they submitted Potter’s name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the
only one in his category. . . .”
“You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,”
said Karkaroff coldly, “and a very ingenious theory it is — though
of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of

  
your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk
egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock.
So you’ll understand if we don’t take you entirely seriously. . . .”
“There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,” Moody retorted in a menacing voice. “It’s my job to think the
way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff — as you ought to remember. . . .”
“Alastor!” said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a
moment whom he was speaking to, but then realized “Mad-Eye”
could hardly be Moody’s real first name. Moody fell silent, though
still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction — Karkaroff’s face was
burning.
“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said Dumbledore,
speaking to everyone gathered in the room. “It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and
Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament. This,
therefore, they will do. . . .”
“Ah, but Dumbly-dorr —”
“My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would
be delighted to hear it.”
Dumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she
merely glared. She wasn’t the only one either. Snape looked furious;
Karkaroff livid; Bagman, however, looked rather excited.
“Well, shall we crack on, then?” he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room. “Got to give our champions
their instructions, haven’t we? Barty, want to do the honors?”
Mr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.
“Yes,” he said, “instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . .”
He moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he
looked ill. There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin,

  
papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the
Quidditch World Cup.
“The first task is designed to test your daring,” he told Harry,
Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, “so we are not going to be telling you
what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important
quality in a wizard . . . very important. . . .
“The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth,
in front of the other students and the panel of judges.
“The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of
any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The champions will face the first challenge armed only with
their wands. They will receive information about the second task
when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and time-consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from
end-of-year tests.”
Mr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.
“I think that’s all, is it, Albus?”
“I think so,” said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch
with mild concern. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?”
“No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,” said Mr.
Crouch. “It is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment. . . .
I’ve left young Weatherby in charge. . . . Very enthusiastic . . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . . .”
“You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?” said
Dumbledore.
“Come on, Barty, I’m staying!” said Bagman brightly. “It’s all
happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here
than at the office!”

  
“I think not, Ludo,” said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience.
“Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap?” said
Dumbledore.
But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur’s
shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could
hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off into the
Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited,
though in silence.
“Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said Dumbledore,
smiling at both of them. “I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are
waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive
them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and
noise.”
Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.
The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low,
giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering
quality.
“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile. “We’re playing against each
other again!”
“I s’pose,” said Harry. He really couldn’t think of anything to
say. The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as
though his brain had been ransacked.
“So . . . tell me . . .” said Cedric as they reached the entrance
hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. “How did you get your name in?”
“I didn’t,” said Harry, staring up at him. “I didn’t put it in. I was
telling the truth.”

  
“Ah . . . okay,” said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn’t believe him. “Well . . . see you, then.”
Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a
door to its right. Harry stood listening to him going down the
stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble
ones.
Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or
would they all think he’d put himself in for the tournament? Yet
how could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors
who’d had three years’ more magical education than he had —
when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he’d thought about it . . . he’d fantasized about it . . . but
it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream . . . he’d never really,
seriously considered entering. . . .
But someone else had considered it . . . someone else had wanted
him in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why?
To give him a treat? He didn’t think so, somehow. . . .
To see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get
their wish. . . .
But to get him killed?
Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn’t someone have put Harry’s name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke?
Did anyone really want him dead?
Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him
dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year
old . . . Lord Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured
that Harry’s name got into the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was

  
supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding,
alone . . . feeble and powerless. . . .
Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his
scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone . . . he had been talking to Wormtail . . . plotting Harry’s murder. . . .
Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He
had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a
surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened
witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had
joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside
the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining
seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady
were looking down at him with the keenest interest.
“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady, “Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”
“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.
“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.
“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and
she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common
room.
The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait
opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he
was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen
pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all
of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.
“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked
half annoyed, half deeply impressed.
“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared
George.

  
“I didn’t,” Harry said. “I don’t know how —”
But Angelina had now swooped down upon him; “Oh if it
couldn’t be me, at least it’s a Gryffindor —”
“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch
match, Harry!” shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor
Chasers.
“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some —”
“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast —”
But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody
wanted to hear that he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one
single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn’t at all in the
mood to celebrate. . . . Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor
banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around
Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn’t get away; whenever he tried to
sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around
him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing
crisps and peanuts into his hands. . . . Everyone wanted to know
how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore’s Age Line and
managed to get his name into the goblet. . . .
“I didn’t,” he said, over and over again, “I don’t know how it
happened.”
But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have
answered at all.
“I’m tired!” he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour. “No,
seriously, George — I’m going to bed —”
He wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to
find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening
the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the

  
foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb
up to the dormitory as fast as he could.
To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the
otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when
Harry slammed the door behind him.
“Where’ve you been?” Harry said.
“Oh hello,” said Ron.
He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin.
Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet
Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to
take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.
“So,” he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and
thrown it into a corner. “Congratulations.”
“What d’you mean, congratulations?” said Harry, staring at
Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was
smiling: It was more like a grimace.
“Well . . . no one else got across the Age Line,” said Ron. “Not
even Fred and George. What did you use — the Invisibility
Cloak?”
“The Invisibility Cloak wouldn’t have got me over that line,” said
Harry slowly.
“Oh right,” said Ron. “I thought you might’ve told me if it was
the cloak . . . because it would’ve covered both of us, wouldn’t it?
But you found another way, did you?”
“Listen,” said Harry, “I didn’t put my name in that goblet.
Someone else must’ve done it.”
Ron raised his eyebrows.
“What would they do that for?”

  
“I dunno,” said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, “To kill me.”
Ron’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.
“It’s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,” he said. “If you
don’t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re
bothering to lie, you didn’t get into trouble for it, did you? That
friend of the Fat Lady’s, that Violet, she’s already told us all Dumbledore’s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh?
And you don’t have to do end-of-year tests either. . . .”
“I didn’t put my name in that goblet!” said Harry, starting to feel
angry.
“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as
Cedric. “Only you said this morning you’d have done it last night,
and no one would’ve seen you. . . . I’m not stupid, you know.”
“You’re doing a really good impression of it,” Harry snapped.
“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. “You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect
you’ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.”
He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving
Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him.

C H A P T E R E I G H T E E N
THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS

When Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a
moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He
sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him — only to find that
Ron’s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.
Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. The moment he appeared, the people who had already
finished breakfast broke into applause again. The prospect of going
down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all
treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that,
however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the
Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to
join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed
it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with
Hermione.
“Hello,” she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. “I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?”
“Good idea,” said Harry gratefully.
They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without
looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn
toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected
blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving,
munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had
happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To
his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.
“Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself,” she said when
he’d finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall.
“The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But
the question is, who did put it in? Because Moody’s right, Harry . . .
I don’t think any student could have done it . . . they’d never be able
to fool the Goblet, or get over Dumbledore’s —”
“Have you seen Ron?” Harry interrupted.
Hermione hesitated.
“Erm . . . yes . . . he was at breakfast,” she said.
“Does he still think I entered myself?”
“Well . . . no, I don’t think so . . . not really,” said Hermione
awkwardly.
“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?”
“Oh Harry, isn’t it obvious?” Hermione said despairingly. “He’s
jealous!”
“Jealous?” Harry said incredulously. “Jealous of what? He wants to
make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?”
“Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it’s always you who gets all
the attention, you know it is. I know it’s not your fault,” she added
quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. “I know you don’t
ask for it . . . but — well — you know, Ron’s got all those brothers
to compete against at home, and you’re his best friend, and you’re
really famous — he’s always shunted to one side whenever people
see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I
suppose this is just one time too many. . . .”
“Great,” said Harry bitterly. “Really great. Tell him from me I’ll
swap any time he wants. Tell him from me he’s welcome to it. . . .
People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go. . . .”
“I’m not telling him anything,” Hermione said shortly. “Tell
him yourself. It’s the only way to sort this out.”
“I’m not running around after him trying to make him grow
up!” Harry said, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took
flight in alarm. “Maybe he’ll believe I’m not enjoying myself once
I’ve got my neck broken or —”
“That’s not funny,” said Hermione quietly. “That’s not funny at
all.” She looked extremely anxious. “Harry, I’ve been thinking —
you know what we’ve got to do, don’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?”
“Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the —”
“Write to Sirius. You’ve got to tell him what’s happened. He
asked you to keep him posted on everything that’s going on at
Hogwarts. . . . It’s almost as if he expected something like this to
happen. I brought some parchment and a quill out with me —”
“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check that they
couldn’t be overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. “He
came back to the country just because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament —”
“He’d want you to tell him,” said Hermione sternly. “He’s going to
find out anyway —”
“How?”
“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said Hermione, very
seriously. “This tournament’s famous, and you’re famous. I’ll be
really surprised if there isn’t anything in the Daily Prophet about
you competing. . . . You’re already in half the books about YouKnow-Who, you know . . . and Sirius would rather hear it from
you, I know he would.”
“Okay, okay, I’ll write to him,” said Harry, throwing his last piece
of toast into the lake. They both stood and watched it floating there
for a moment, before a large tentacle rose out of the water and
scooped it beneath the surface. Then they returned to the castle.
“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they climbed the
stairs. “He told me not to use Hedwig again.”
“Ask Ron if you can borrow —”
“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.
“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use
them,” said Hermione.
They went up to the Owlery Hermione gave Harry a piece of
parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the
long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while Harry
sat down against a wall and wrote his letter.
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts, so here goes — I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday
night I got picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my
name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled
inside his chest since last night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink
bottle and wrote,
Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak —
“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing
straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his
shoulder and held out her leg.
“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for the school
owls. “I’ve got to use one of these. . . .”
Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her
talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time
he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn
owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she
clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of
reach.
“First Ron, then you,” said Harry angrily. “This isn’t my fault.”
If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone
got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day
showed him how mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the
rest of the school once he was back at lessons — and it was clear
that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry 
had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors,
however, they did not seem impressed.
The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the
Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of
them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It
was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their
champion’s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that
Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was
one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten
Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk
to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the
same tray — though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one
of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip and
smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry either.
Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but
though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed
distant with him — but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under
normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing
the Slytherins too — the first time he would come face-to-face
with them since becoming champion.
Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar
sneer firmly in place.
“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle
the moment he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph
books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to
be around much longer. . . . Half the Triwizard champions have
died . . . how long d’you reckon you’re going to last, Potter? Ten
minutes into the first task’s my bet.”
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to
stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin
balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large
Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class’s horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was
an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for
each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk.
The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy
completely.
“Take this thing for a walk?” he repeated in disgust, staring into
one of the boxes. “And where exactly are we supposed to fix the
leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?”
“Roun’ the middle,” said Hagrid, demonstrating. “Er — yeh
might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus’ as an extra precaution, like. Harry — you come here an’ help me with this big
one. . . .”
Hagrid’s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry away from
the rest of the class. He waited until everyone else had set off with
their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, “So —
yer competin’, Harry. In the tournament. School champion.”
“One of the champions,” Harry corrected him.
Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild
eyebrows.
“No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?”
“You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said Harry, concealing with
difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid’s words.
“ ’Course I do,” Hagrid grunted. “Yeh say it wasn’ you, an’ I believe yeh — an’ Dumbledore believes yer, an’ all.”
“Wish I knew who did do it,” said Harry bitterly.
The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely
scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over
three feet long, and extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and
colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor.
They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated
crabs — but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.
“Look like they’re havin’ fun, don’ they?” Hagrid said happily.
Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren’t; every now and then, with an alarming
bang, one of the skrewts’ ends would explode, causing it to shoot
forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged
along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.
“Ah, I don’ know, Harry,” Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back
down at him with a worried expression on his face. “School champion . . . everythin’ seems ter happen ter you, doesn’ it?”
Harry didn’t answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to
him . . . that was more or less what Hermione had said as they had
walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to her,
that Ron was no longer talking to him.
The next few days were some of Harry’s worst at Hogwarts. The
closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those
months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had been on
his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the
school’s behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but
he wasn’t going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn’t
want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him
from all sides.
He could understand the Hufflepuffs’ attitude, even if he didn’t
like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected
nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins — he was
highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had
helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in
the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws
might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as
Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think
that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.
Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his
straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was
receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum.
Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen
to get Krum’s autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags
one lunchtime.
Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing
to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his
death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at
Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick’s class that he was given
extra homework — the only person to get any, apart from Neville.
“It’s really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione tried to reassure
him as they left Flitwick’s class — she had been making objects
zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some
sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and
lunascopes. “You just weren’t concentrating properly —”
“Wonder why that was,” said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory
walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of
whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large BlastEnded Skrewt. “Still — never mind, eh? Double Potions to look
forward to this afternoon. . . .”
Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days
it was nothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an
hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed
determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing
Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday’s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore
them, ignore them, ignore them” under her breath, and he couldn’t see why today should be any better.
When he and Hermione arrived at Snape’s dungeon after lunch,
they found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of
them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes. For one
wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges — then he
saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters
that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage:
“Like them, Potter?” said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached.
“And this isn’t all they do — look!”
He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it
vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green:
The Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed
their badges too, until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt the heat rise in his face and
neck.
“Oh very funny,” Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson
and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than
anyone, “really witty.”
Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He
wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sticking up for Harry either.
“Want one, Granger?” said Malfoy, holding out a badge to
Hermione. “I’ve got loads. But don’t touch my hand, now. I’ve just
washed it, you see; don’t want a Mudblood sliming it up.”
Some of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days
seemed to burst through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his
wand before he’d thought what he was doing. People all around
them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor.
“Harry!” Hermione said warningly.
“Go on, then, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own
wand. “Moody’s not here to look after you now — do it, if you’ve
got the guts —”
For a split second, they looked into each other’s eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.
“Furnunculus!” Harry yelled.
“Densaugeo!” screamed Malfoy.
Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and
ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit Hermione. Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose,
where great ugly boils were springing up — Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.
“Hermione!”
Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry
turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione’s hand away from her
face. It wasn’t a pretty sight. Hermione’s front teeth — already
larger than average — were now growing at an alarming rate; she
was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated,
past her bottom lip, toward her chin — panic-stricken, she felt
them and let out a terrified cry.
“And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice.
Snape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said,
“Explain.”
“Potter attacked me, sir —”
“We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted.
“— and he hit Goyle — look —”
Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something
that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
“Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.
“Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Look!”
He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth — she was doing
her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as
they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the
other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing
at Hermione from behind Snape’s back.
Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no
difference.”
Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she
turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out
of sight.
It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting
at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the
stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to
hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however.
“Let’s see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from
Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get
inside, or it’ll be a week’s worth of detentions.”
Harry’s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to
curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked
with Ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down
onto the table. Ron was shaking with anger too — for a moment,
it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but
then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead,
leaving Harry alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon,
Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge, smirking.
POTTER STINKS flashed once more across the room.
Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing
horrific things happening to him. . . . If only he knew how to do
the Cruciatus Curse . . . he’d have Snape flat on his back like that
spider, jerking and twitching. . . .
“Antidotes!” said Snape, looking around at them all, his cold
black eyes glittering unpleasantly. “You should all have prepared
your recipes now. I want you to brew them carefully, and then, we
will be selecting someone on whom to test one. . . .”
Snape’s eyes met Harry’s, and Harry knew what was coming.
Snape was going to poison him. Harry imagined picking up his
cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it
down on Snape’s greasy head —
And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry’s
thoughts.
It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at
Harry, and walked up to Snape’s desk at the front of the room.
“Yes?” said Snape curtly.
“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.”
Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded
from his eager face.
“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said Snape
coldly. “He will come upstairs when this class is finished.”
Colin went pink.
“Sir — sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously. “All the
champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs. . . .”
Harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped
Colin saying those last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron,
but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.
“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped. “Potter, leave your things
here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”
“Please, sir — he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked
Colin. “All the champions —”
“Very well !” said Snape. “Potter — take your bag and get out of
my sight!”
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for
the door. As he walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER
STINKS flashed at him from every direction.
“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to speak the
moment Harry had closed the dungeon door behind him. “Isn’t it,
though? You being champion?”
“Yeah, really amazing,” said Harry heavily as they set off toward
the steps into the entrance hall. “What do they want photos for,
Colin?”
“The Daily Prophet, I think!”
“Great,” said Harry dully. “Exactly what I need. More publicity.”
“Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the right room.
Harry knocked on the door and entered.
He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been
pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the
middle; three of them, however, had been placed end-to-end in
front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet.
Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered desks, and Ludo
Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had
never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes.
Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not
talking to anybody. Cedric and Fleur were in conversation. Fleur
looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept
throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the
light. A paunchy man, holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.
Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded
forward.
“Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in
you come . . . nothing to worry about, it’s just the wand weighing
ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment —”
“Wand weighing?” Harry repeated nervously.
“We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no
problems, you know, as they’re your most important tools in the
tasks ahead,” said Bagman. “The expert’s upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there’s going to be a little photo shoot. This is
Rita Skeeter,” he added, gesturing toward the witch in magenta
robes. “She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily
Prophet. . . .”
“Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on
Harry.
Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended
in two-inch nails, painted crimson.
“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we
start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. “The
youngest champion, you know . . . to add a bit of color?”
“Certainly!” cried Bagman. “That is — if Harry has no objection?”
“Er —” said Harry.
“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned
fingers had Harry’s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and
she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby
door.
“We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she said. “Let’s
see . . . ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.”
It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.
“Come along, dear — that’s right — lovely,” said Rita Skeeter
again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket,
pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door,
throwing them into darkness. “Let’s see now . . .”
She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out
a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand
and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were
doing.
“You won’t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill? It leaves
me free to talk to you normally. . . .”
“A what?” said Harry.
Rita Skeeter’s smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth.
She reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acidgreen quill and a roll of parchment, which she stretched out
between them on a crate of Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose Magical
Mess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth,
sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright
on the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering
slightly.
“Testing . . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.”
Harry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita
Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:
Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage
quill has punctured many inflated reputations —
“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top
piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her
handbag. Now she leaned toward Harry and said, “So, Harry . . .
what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?”
“Er —” said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill.
Even though he wasn’t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence:
An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the
otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes —
“Ignore the quill, Harry,” said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly,
Harry looked up at her instead. “Now — why did you decide to
enter the tournament, Harry?”
“I didn’t,” said Harry. “I don’t know how my name got into the
Goblet of Fire. I didn’t put it in there.”
Rita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.
“Come now, Harry, there’s no need to be scared of getting into
trouble. We all know you shouldn’t really have entered at all. But
don’t worry about that. Our readers love a rebel.”
“But I didn’t enter,” Harry repeated. “I don’t know who —”
“How do you feel about the tasks ahead?” said Rita Skeeter.
“Excited? Nervous?”
“I haven’t really thought . . . yeah, nervous, I suppose,” said
Harry. His insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke.
“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said Rita
Skeeter briskly. “Have you thought about that at all?”
“Well . . . they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,” said
Harry.
The quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back
and forward as though it were skating.
“Of course, you’ve looked death in the face before, haven’t you?”
said Rita Skeeter, watching him closely. “How would you say that’s
affected you?”
“Er,” said Harry, yet again.
“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made
you keen to prove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think
that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament
because —”
“I didn’t enter,” said Harry, starting to feel irritated.
“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over him.
“No,” said Harry.
“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing
in the Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?”
Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to
know how his parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel
Rita Skeeter watching him very intently. Frowning, he avoided her
gaze and looked down at words the quill had just written:
Tears fill those startling green eyes as our conversation
turns to the parents he can barely remember.
“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.
Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom
cupboard was pulled open. Harry looked around, blinking in the
bright light. Albus Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both
of them, squashed into the cupboard.
“Dumbledore!” cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of
delight — but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had
suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and
Rita’s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her
crocodile-skin bag. “How are you?” she said, standing up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. “I hope
you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards’ Conference?”
“Enchantingly nasty,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “I
particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.”
Rita Skeeter didn’t look remotely abashed.
“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little
old-fashioned, Dumbledore, and that many wizards in the street —”
“I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness,
Rita,” said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but
I’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later. The Weighing of
the Wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our
champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.”
Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into
the room. The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the
door, and he sat down quickly next to Cedric, looking up at the
velvet-covered table, where four of the five judges were now sitting — Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr. Crouch, and
Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry
saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her
knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once
more on the parchment.
“May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?” said Dumbledore, taking his
place at the judges’ table and talking to the champions. “He will be
checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.”
Harry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had
met Mr. Ollivander before — he was the wand-maker from whom
Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon
Alley.
“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said
Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the
room.
Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and handed him
her wand.
“Hmmm . . .” he said.
He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it
emitted a number of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it close to
his eyes and examined it carefully.
“Yes,” he said quietly, “nine and a half inches . . . inflexible . . .
rosewood . . . and containing . . . dear me . . .”
“An ’air from ze ’ead of a veela,” said Fleur. “One of my
grandmuzzer’s.”
So Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to
tell Ron . . . then he remembered that Ron wasn’t speaking to him.
“Yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, “yes, I’ve never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather temperamental wands . . .
however, to each his own, and if this suits you . . .”
Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered, “Orchideous!” and a
bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip.
“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with
her wand. “Mr. Diggory, you next.”
Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.
“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with
much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. “Yes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn . . . must have been seventeen hands; nearly
gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches . . . ash . . . pleasantly springy. It’s in fine condition. . . .
You treat it regularly?”
“Polished it last night,” said Cedric, grinning.
Harry looked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks
all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to
rub it clean surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the end
of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he
desisted.
Mr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the
room from the tip of Cedric’s wand, pronounced himself satisfied,
and then said, “Mr. Krum, if you please.”
Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duckfooted, toward Mr. Ollivander. He thrust out his wand and stood
scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes.
“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch creation,
unless I’m much mistaken? A fine wand-maker, though the styling
is never quite what I . . . however . . .”
He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over
and over before his eyes.
“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at Krum,
who nodded. “Rather thicker than one usually sees . . . quite
rigid . . . ten and a quarter inches . . . Avis!”
The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of
small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open
window into the watery sunlight.
“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand.
“Which leaves . . . Mr. Potter.”
Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander.
He handed over his wand.
“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. “Yes, yes, yes. How well I remember.”
Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it
had happened yesterday. . . .
Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr.
Ollivander’s shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had
taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to
try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at
last he had found the one that suited him — this one, which was
made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather
from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised
that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. “Curious,” he
had said, “curious,” and not until Harry asked what was curious
had Mr. Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry’s
wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of
Lord Voldemort’s.
Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody.
He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort’s wand was something it couldn’t help —
rather as he couldn’t help being related to Aunt Petunia. However,
he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn’t about to tell the room
about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill
might just explode with excitement if he did.
Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry’s wand
than anyone else’s. Eventually, however, he made a fountain of
wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that
it was still in perfect condition.
“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges’
table. “You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it
would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to
end —”
Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got
up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and
cleared his throat.
“Photos, Dumbledore, photos!” cried Bagman excitedly. “All the
judges and champions, what do you think, Rita?”
“Er — yes, let’s do those first,” said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes
were upon Harry again. “And then perhaps some individual shots.”
The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer
couldn’t stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually
she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept
twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum,
whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this
sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The
photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita
Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater
prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.
Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn’t there — he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He
ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor
Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that
he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.
“You’ve had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment he walked
in. He was pointing at Harry’s pillow. The school barn owl was
waiting for him there.
“Oh — right,” said Harry.
“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape’s
dungeon,” said Ron.
He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry.
For a moment, Harry considered going after him — he wasn’t sure
whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing — but the lure of Sirius’s answer was too strong. Harry
strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.
Harry —
I can’t say everything I would like to in a letter, it’s too risky
in case the owl is intercepted — we need to talk face-to-face.
Can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in Gryffindor
Tower at one o’clock in the morning on the 2nd of November?
I know better than anyone that you can look after yourself
and while you’re around Dumbledore and Moody I don’t think
anyone will be able to hurt you. However, someone seems to be
having a good try. Entering you in that tournament would
have been very risky, especially right under Dumbledore’s nose.
Be on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about anything
unusual. Let me know about the 22nd of November as quickly
as you can.

C H A P T E R N I N E T E E N
THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL

The prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that
sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot
on a horizon that had never looked darker. The shock of finding
himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of
what was facing him had started to sink in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of
him like some horrific monster, barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against
Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup.
Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as
though his whole life had been leading up to, and would finish
with, the first task. . . .
Admittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to make him feel
any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult
and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere
sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. Harry
wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be beside the common
room fire at the time Sirius had suggested, and he and Hermione
spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of
the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the
worst, they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped
they wouldn’t have to resort to that — Filch would skin them alive.
In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the
confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece
about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not
so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story
of Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a picture
of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had
been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line
of the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.
The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick,
burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought
about it. Rita Skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of
things that he couldn’t remember ever saying in his life, let alone in
that broom cupboard.
I suppose I get my strength from my parents. I
know they’d be very proud of me if they could see
me now. . . . Yes, sometimes at night I still cry
about them, I’m not ashamed to admit it. . . . I
know nothing will hurt me during the tournament,
because they’re watching over me. . . .
But Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his
“er’s” into long, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people
about him too.
Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close
friend, Colin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen
out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a
stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry,
is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to
endure people — Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he
passed and making sneering comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”
“Since when have you been one of the top students in the
school, Potter? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up
together?”
“Hey — Harry!”
“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled
around in the corridor, having had just about enough. “I’ve just
been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and I’m just off to do
a bit more. . . .”
“No — it was just — you dropped your quill.”
It was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.
“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill back.
“Er . . . good luck on Tuesday,” she said. “I really hope you do
well.”

  
Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid
Hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too,
but she hadn’t yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact,
Harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the
situation.
“Stunningly pretty? Her?” Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first
time she had come face-to-face with Hermione after Rita’s article
had appeared. “What was she judging against — a chipmunk?”
“Ignore it,” Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head
in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though
she couldn’t hear them. “Just ignore it, Harry.”
But Harry couldn’t ignore it. Ron hadn’t spoken to him at all
since he had told him about Snape’s detentions. Harry had half
hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were
forced to pickle rats’ brains in Snape’s dungeon, but that had been
the day Rita’s article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed Ron’s belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention.
Hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one
to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry
was adamant: He would talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted
that Harry hadn’t put his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar.
“I didn’t start this,” Harry said stubbornly. “It’s his problem.”
“You miss him!” Hermione said impatiently. “And I know he
misses you —”
“Miss him?” said Harry. “I don’t miss him. . . .”
But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much,
but she just wasn’t the same as Ron. There was much less laughter
and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was
your best friend. Harry still hadn’t mastered Summoning Charms,
he seemed to have developed something of a block about them,
and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. They
consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their
lunchtimes.
Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry
wondered what he was up to. Was he studying, or was he looking
for things to help him through the first task? Hermione often complained about Krum being there — not that he ever bothered
them — but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy
on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise
distracting.
“He’s not even good-looking!” she muttered angrily, glaring at
Krum’s sharp profile. “They only like him because he’s famous!
They wouldn’t look twice at him if he couldn’t do that WonkyFaint thing —”
“Wronski Feint,” said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart
from liking to get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another
pang to imagine Ron’s expression if he could have heard Hermione
talking about Wonky-Faints.
It is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and
would give anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit
of speeding up. The days until the first task seemed to slip by as
though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed.
Harry’s feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he
went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet
article.
On the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third

  
year and above were permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade.
Hermione told Harry that it would do him good to get away from
the castle for a bit, and Harry didn’t need much persuasion.
“What about Ron, though?” he said. “Don’t you want to go with
him?”
“Oh . . . well . . .” Hermione went slightly pink. “I thought we
might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks. . . .”
“No,” said Harry flatly.
“Oh Harry, this is so stupid —”
“I’ll come, but I’m not meeting Ron, and I’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak.”
“Oh all right then . . .” Hermione snapped, “but I hate talking
to you in that cloak, I never know if I’m looking at you or not.”
So Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went
back downstairs, and together he and Hermione set off for
Hogsmeade.
Harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he watched other
students walking past them as they entered the village, most of
them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that
stupid article.
“People keep looking at me now,” said Hermione grumpily as
they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large creamfilled chocolates. “They think I’m talking to myself.”
“Don’t move your lips so much then.”
“Come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no one’s going to bother you here.”
“Oh yeah?” said Harry. “Look behind you.”
Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from
the Three Broomsticks pub. Talking in low voices, they passed
right by Hermione without looking at her. Harry backed into the
wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him with her
crocodile-skin handbag. When they were gone, Harry said, “She’s
staying in the village. I bet she’s coming to watch the first task.”
As he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic.
He didn’t mention this; he and Hermione hadn’t discussed what
was coming in the first task much; he had the feeling she didn’t
want to think about it.
“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street. “Why don’t we go and have a butterbeer
in the Three Broomsticks, it’s a bit cold, isn’t it? You don’t have to
talk to Ron!” she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence.
The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else. Harry supposed that as
Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit of
a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at
disguising themselves.
It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility
Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to
lead to awkward questions. Harry edged slowly toward a spare
table in the corner while Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way
through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting with Fred,
George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard
poke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat
down at it.
Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak.

  
“I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,” she muttered. “Lucky I brought something to do.”
And she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a
record of S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron’s names at the
top of the very short list. It seemed a long time ago that they had
sat making up those predictions together, and Hermione had
turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer.
“You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W.,” Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around
the pub.
“Yeah, right,” said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer under his
cloak. “Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew
stuff?”
“When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions!”
she hissed back. “You know, I’m starting to think it’s time for more
direct action. I wonder how you get into the school kitchens?”
“No idea, ask Fred and George,” said Harry.
Hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his
butterbeer, watching the people in the pub. All of them looked
cheerful and relaxed. Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were
swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them
sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their cloaks. Right over
by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw
friends. She wasn’t wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This
cheered up Harry very slightly. . . .
What wouldn’t he have given to be one of these people, sitting
around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but
homework? He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his
name hadn’t come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn’t be
  
wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sitting
with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining
what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing
on Tuesday. He’d have been really looking forward to it, watching
them do whatever it was . . . cheering on Cedric with everyone
else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands. . . .
He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time
he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and
looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from
time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did,
haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in the library, poring
over books.
Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest
seemed to ease slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over
twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the
common room fire — assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately. . . .
“Look, it’s Hagrid!” said Hermione.
The back of Hagrid’s enormous shaggy head — he had mercifully abandoned his bunches — emerged over the crowd. Harry
wondered why he hadn’t spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so
large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his
hip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn’t seem to
think much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she thought it was
an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had
told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson

  
that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as
it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup.
As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave.
He waved, then remembered that Hagrid couldn’t see him. Moody,
however, paused, his magical eye on the corner where Harry was
standing. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being unable
to reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the
pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and
Hermione’s table.
“All right, Hermione?” said Hagrid loudly.
“Hello,” said Hermione, smiling back.
Moody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought
he was reading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, “Nice
cloak, Potter.”
Harry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing
from Moody’s nose was particularly obvious at a few inches’ distance. Moody grinned.
“Can your eye — I mean, can you — ?”
“Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,” Moody said quietly. “And it’s come in useful at times, I can tell you.”
Hagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew Hagrid
couldn’t see him, but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was
there. Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the
S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only
Harry could hear it, “Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me
cabin. Wear that cloak.”
Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see yeh,
Hermione,” winked, and departed. Moody followed him.
“Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?” Harry
said, very surprised.
“Does he?” said Hermione, looking startled. “I wonder what he’s
up to? I don’t know whether you should go, Harry. . . .” She looked
nervously around and hissed, “It might make you late for Sirius.”
It was true that going down to Hagrid’s at midnight would mean
cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid’s to tell him he couldn’t
go — always assuming she would consent to take the note, of
course — Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what this
might be; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night.
At half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go
up to bed early, pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and
crept back downstairs through the common room. Quite a few
people were still in there. The Creevey brothers had managed to get
hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory! badges and were trying to
bewitch them to make them say Support Harry Potter! instead. So
far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck
on POTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait hole
and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. Then
Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had
planned. He slipped past her with a whispered “Thanks!” and set
off through the castle.
The grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward
the lights shining in Hagrid’s cabin. The inside of the enormous
Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; Harry could hear Madame
Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid’s front door.

  
“You there, Harry?” Hagrid whispered, opening the door and
looking around.
“Yeah,” said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the
cloak down off his head. “What’s up?”
“Got summat ter show yeh,” said Hagrid.
There was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was
wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle
grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair — Harry
could see the comb’s broken teeth tangled in it.
“What’re you showing me?” Harry said warily, wondering if the
skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant
three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub.
“Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered with that
cloak,” said Hagrid. “We won’ take Fang, he won’ like it. . . .”
“Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long. . . . I’ve got to be back up at
the castle by one o’clock —”
But Hagrid wasn’t listening; he was opening the cabin door and
striding off into the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to
his great surprise, that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons
carriage.
“Hagrid, what — ?”
“Shhh!” said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door
bearing the crossed golden wands.
Madame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped
around her massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid.
“Ah, ’Agrid . . . it is time?”
“Bong-sewer,” said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a
hand to help her down the golden steps.
Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her
his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime’s giant winged horses, with Harry, totally
bewildered, running to keep up with them. Had Hagrid wanted to
show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he
wanted . . . she wasn’t exactly hard to miss. . . .
But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as
Harry, because after a while she said playfully, “Wair is it you are
taking me, ’Agrid?”
“Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said Hagrid gruffly, “worth seein’, trust me.
On’y — don’ go tellin’ anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh’re not
s’posed ter know.”
“Of course not,” said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long
black eyelashes.
And still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as
he jogged along in their wake, checking his watch every now and
then. Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might
make him miss Sirius. If they didn’t get there soon, he was going to
turn around, go straight back to the castle, and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime. . . .
But then — when they had walked so far around the perimeter
of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight — Harry
heard something. Men were shouting up ahead . . . then came a
deafening, earsplitting roar. . . .
Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came
to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them — for a split second, he
thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them —
and then his mouth fell open.
Dragons.

  
Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks
of wood, roaring and snorting — torrents of fire were shooting into
the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the
ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery-blue one
with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on
the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and
stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold
spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire
clouds into the air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard-like than
the others, which was nearest to them.
At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were
attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to
heavy leather straps around their necks and legs. Mesmerized,
Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black
dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or
rage, he couldn’t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise, a
yowling, screeching scream. . . .
“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding. “They can shoot fire at a range of
twenty feet, you know! I’ve seen this Horntail do forty!”
“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly.
“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning Spells, on the
count of three!”
Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.
“Stupefy!” they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot
into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on
the dragons’ scaly hides —
Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on
its back legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils
were suddenly devoid of flame, though still smoking — then, very
slowly, it fell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the
ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the trees
behind him quake.
The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to
their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They
hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs,
which they forced deep into the ground with their wands.
“Wan’ a closer look?” Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly.
The pair of them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed.
The wizard who had warned Hagrid not to come any closer
turned, and Harry realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.
“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk. “They
should be okay now — we put them out with a Sleeping Draft on
the way here, thought it might be better for them to wake up in the
dark and the quiet — but, like you saw, they weren’t happy, not
happy at all —”
“What breeds you got here, Charlie?” said Hagrid, gazing at the
closest dragon, the black one, with something close to reverence.
Its eyes were still just open. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid.
“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie. “There’s a Common Welsh Green over there, the smaller one — a Swedish ShortSnout, that blue-gray — and a Chinese Fireball, that’s the red.”
Charlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away
around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the stunned dragons.

  
“I didn’t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,” Charlie said,
frowning. “The champions aren’t supposed to know what’s coming — she’s bound to tell her student, isn’t she?”
“Jus’ thought she’d like ter see ’em,” shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons.
“Really romantic date, Hagrid,” said Charlie, shaking his head.
“Four . . .” said Hagrid, “so it’s one fer each o’ the champions, is
it? What’ve they gotta do — fight ’em?”
“Just get past them, I think,” said Charlie. “We’ll be on hand if
it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don’t know why . . . but I tell you this, I don’t envy
the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious thing. Its back end’s as dangerous as its front, look.”
Charlie pointed toward the Horntail’s tail, and Harry saw long,
bronze-colored spikes protruding along it every few inches.
Five of Charlie’s fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at
that moment, carrying a clutch of huge granite-gray eggs between
them in a blanket. They placed them carefully at the Horntail’s
side. Hagrid let out a moan of longing.
“I’ve got them counted, Hagrid,” said Charlie sternly. Then he
said, “How’s Harry?”
“Fine,” said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.
“Just hope he’s still fine after he’s faced this lot,” said Charlie
grimly, looking out over the dragons’ enclosure. “I didn’t dare tell
Mum what he’s got to do for the first task; she’s already having kittens about him. . . .” Charlie imitated his mother’s anxious voice.
“ ‘How could they let him enter that tournament, he’s much too young!
I thought they were all safe, I thought there was going to be an age
limit!’ She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him.
‘He still cries about his parents! Oh bless him, I never knew!’ ”
Harry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn’t
miss him, with the attractions of four dragons and Madame
Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently and began to walk away,
back to the castle.
He didn’t know whether he was glad he’d seen what was coming
or not. Perhaps this way was better. The first shock was over now.
Maybe if he’d seen the dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he
would have passed out cold in front of the whole school . . . but
maybe he would anyway. . . . He was going to be armed with his
wand — which, just now, felt like nothing more than a narrow
strip of wood — against a fifty-foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, firebreathing dragon. And he had to get past it. With everyone watching. How?
Harry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under
fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he
couldn’t remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he
did right now — when, without warning, he ran into something
very solid.
Harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around
him. A voice nearby said, “Ouch! Who’s there?”
Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and lay
very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He
recognized the goatee . . . it was Karkaroff.
“Who’s there?” said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking
around in the darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a
minute or so, Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort

  
of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the cover of the
trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.
Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off
again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying
through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.
He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had
sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going
to be. He might even have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime
heading off around the forest together — they were hardly difficult
to spot at a distance . . . and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would
know what was in store for the champions.
By the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the
unknown on Tuesday was Cedric.
Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and
began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he
didn’t dare slow down. . . . He had less than five minutes to get up
to the fire. . . .
“Balderdash!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in
her frame in front of the portrait hole.
“If you say so,” she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes,
and the picture swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact
that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off
any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.
Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an
armchair in front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the
flames were the only source of light. Nearby, on a table, the Support
Cedric Diggory! badges the Creeveys had been trying to improve
were glinting in the firelight. They now read POTTER REALLY
STINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped.
Sirius’s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn’t seen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys’ kitchen, it would have
scared him out of his wits. Instead, his face breaking into the first
smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched
down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius — how’re you doing?”
Sirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him. When they
had said good-bye, Sirius’s face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair — but the hair
was short and clean now, Sirius’s face was fuller, and he looked
younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him,
which had been taken at the Potters’ wedding.
“Never mind me, how are you?” said Sirius seriously.
“I’m —” For a second, Harry tried to say “fine” — but he couldn’t
do it. Before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he’d
talked in days — about how no one believed he hadn’t entered the
tournament of his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about
him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn’t walk down a corridor
without being sneered at — and about Ron, Ron not believing him,
Ron’s jealousy . . .
“. . . and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in the first
task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner,” he finished desperately.
Sirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet
lost the look that Azkaban had given them — that deadened,
haunted look. He had let Harry talk himself into silence without

  
interruption, but now he said, “Dragons we can deal with, Harry,
but we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long here . . . I’ve
broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be
back at any time. There are things I need to warn you about.”
“What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few
notches. . . . Surely there could be nothing worse than dragons
coming?
“Karkaroff,” said Sirius. “Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know
what Death Eaters are, don’t you?”
“Yes — he — what?”
“He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released.
I’d bet everything that’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at
Hogwarts this year — to keep an eye on him. Moody caught
Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first place.”
“Karkaroff got released?” Harry said slowly — his brain seemed
to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information. “Why did they release him?”
“He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,” said Sirius bitterly.
“He said he’d seen the error of his ways, and then he named
names . . . he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his
place. . . . He’s not very popular in there, I can tell you. And since
he got out, from what I can tell, he’s been teaching the Dark Arts
to every student who passes through that school of his. So watch
out for the Durmstrang champion as well.”
“Okay,” said Harry slowly. “But . . . are you saying Karkaroff
put my name in the goblet? Because if he did, he’s a really good
actor. He seemed furious about it. He wanted to stop me from
competing.”

“We know he’s a good actor,” said Sirius, “because he convinced
the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn’t he? Now, I’ve been
keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet, Harry —”
“— you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly.
“— and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman’s article last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at
Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm,” Sirius
said hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, “but I don’t think so,
somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult
with him around. And no one’s going to look into it too closely;
Mad-Eye’s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn’t mean he
can’t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had.”
“So . . . what are you saying?” said Harry slowly. “Karkaroff’s
trying to kill me? But — why?”
Sirius hesitated.
“I’ve been hearing some very strange things,” he said slowly.
“The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately.
They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn’t they?
Someone set off the Dark Mark . . . and then — did you hear
about that Ministry of Magic witch who’s gone missing?”
“Bertha Jorkins?” said Harry.
“Exactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely
where Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have
known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?”
“Yeah, but . . . it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into
Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.

  
“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly. “She was
at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me.
And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not
a good combination, Harry. I’d say she’d be very easy to lure into a
trap.
“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said Harry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff
might be here on his orders?”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . .
Karkaroff doesn’t strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort
unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him.
But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and
I can’t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to
attack you and make it look like an accident.”
“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said
Harry grinning bleakly. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the
dragons do their stuff.”
“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly
now. “There’s a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning
Spell — dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be
knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon —”
“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.
“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way, and a simple spell’s all you need. Just —”
But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly
pounding as though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him.
“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “Go! There’s someone coming!”
Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw
Sirius’s face within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an
almighty uproar — the Ministry would get dragged in — he,
Harry, would be questioned about Sirius’s whereabouts —
Harry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius
had gone. He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had
decided to go for a stroll at one o’clock in the morning, and
stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon?
It was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped
dead facing Harry across the room, and looked around.
“Who were you talking to?” he said.
“What’s that got to do with you?” Harry snarled. “What are you
doing down here at this time of night?”
“I just wondered where you —” Ron broke off, shrugging.
“Nothing. I’m going back to bed.”
“Just thought you’d come nosing around, did you?” Harry
shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he’d walked in on,
knew he hadn’t done it on purpose, but he didn’t care — at this
moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several
inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.
“Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with anger.
“Should’ve realized you didn’t want to be disturbed. I’ll let you get
on with practicing for your next interview in peace.”
Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off
the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit
Ron on the forehead and bounced off.
“There you go,” Harry said. “Something for you to wear on

  
Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if you’re lucky. . . . That’s
what you want, isn’t it?”
He strode across the room toward the stairs; he half expected
Ron to stop him, he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch
at him, but Ron just stood there in his too-small pajamas, and
Harry, having stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long
time afterward and didn’t hear him come up to bed.

C H A P T E R T W E N T Y
THE FIRST TAS K

Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying
to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock. When he’d finally
got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to
find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great
Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too
queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last
spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds.
There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything
Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.
Alarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about Karkaroff,
Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing
problem.
“Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,” she said
desperately, “and then we can worry about Karkaroff.”
CHAPTER TWENTY
They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to
think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead.
Here, Harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons,
and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.
“ ‘Talon-clipping by charms . . . treating scale-rot . . .’ This is no
good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them
healthy. . . .”
“ ‘Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic
that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells
can penetrate . . .’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it. . . .”
“Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then,” said Harry, throwing
aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much.
He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them
down, and began to flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.
“Well, there are Switching Spells . . . but what’s the point of
Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous. . . . The trouble is, like
that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon’s
hide. . . . I’d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really
haven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . unless
you’re supposed to put the spell on yourself ? Maybe to give yourself
extra powers? But they’re not simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done
any of those in class, I only know about them because I’ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . .”
“Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will you shut
up for a bit, please? I’m trying to concentrate.”
But all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that
THE FIRST TASK
  
Harry’s brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn’t seem
to allow room for concentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping . . . but
dragons had no hair . . . pepper breath . . . that would probably increase a dragon’s firepower . . . horn tongue . . . just what he
needed, to give it an extra weapon . . .
“Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his stupid ship?”
said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly
look over at the pair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books. “Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the
common room . . . his fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering
away. . . .”
And sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed
past them, one of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her
waist.
Harry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running
away from Hogwarts. But as he looked around the Great Hall at
breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would
mean, he knew he couldn’t do it. It was the only place he had ever
been happy . . . well, he supposed he must have been happy with
his parents too, but he couldn’t remember that.
Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to
know; it made him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with
difficulty (his throat wasn’t working too well), and as he and
Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff
table.

  
Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons . . . the only champion who didn’t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and
Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum. . . .
“Hermione, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” Harry said, coming
to his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. “Go on, I’ll
catch you up.”
“Harry, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring —”
“I’ll catch you up, okay?”
By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase,
Cedric was at the top. He was with a load of sixth-year friends.
Harry didn’t want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were
among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter’s article at him
every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance
and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This
gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out
his wand, and took careful aim.
“Diffindo!”
Cedric’s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it
onto the floor. Several bottles of ink smashed.
“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends
bent down to help him. “Tell Flitwick I’m coming, go on. . . .”
This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his
wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric’s friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which
was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.
“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced
Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink. “My bag just
split . . . brand-new and all . . .”
“Cedric,” said Harry, “the first task is dragons.”

  
“What?” said Cedric, looking up.
“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. “They’ve got four,
one for each of us, and we’ve got to get past them.”
Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he’d been
feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes.
“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.
“Dead sure,” said Harry. “I’ve seen them.”
“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know. . . .”
“Never mind,” said Harry quickly — he knew Hagrid would be
in trouble if he told the truth. “But I’m not the only one who knows.
Fleur and Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both
saw the dragons too.”
Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment,
and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at
Harry, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.
“Why are you telling me?” he asked.
Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn’t
have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn’t
have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared — well,
perhaps Malfoy or Snape . . .
“It’s just . . . fair, isn’t it?” he said to Cedric. “We all know
now . . . we’re on an even footing, aren’t we?”
Cedric was still looking at him in a slightly suspicious way when
Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned
around and saw Mad-Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.
“Come with me, Potter,” he growled. “Diggory, off you go.”
Harry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them?

  
“Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology —”
“Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. . . .”
Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to
him now. What if Moody wanted to know how he’d found out
about the dragons? Would Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on
Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to
get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he’d be
smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet . . .
He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon
him as well as the normal one.
“That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,” Moody said
quietly.
Harry didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the reaction he had
expected at all.
“Sit down,” said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.
He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In
Professor Lockhart’s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin
had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of
some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to
study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in
the days when he had been an Auror.
On his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he
owned one himself, though it was much smaller than Moody’s. In
the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something
like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming

  
slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the
wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus.
“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” said Moody, who was
watching Harry closely.
“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden
aerial.
“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and
lies . . . no use here, of course, too much interference — students
in every direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework. Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my
Sneakoscope because it wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s extra-sensitive,
picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking
up more than kid stuff,” he added in a growl.
“And what’s the mirror for?”
“Oh that’s my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around?
I’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That’s
when I open my trunk.”
He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk
under the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered
what was in there, until Moody’s next question brought him
sharply back to earth.
“So . . . found out about the dragons, have you?”
Harry hesitated. He’d been afraid of this — but he hadn’t told
Cedric, and he certainly wasn’t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid
had broken the rules.
“It’s all right,” said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his
wooden leg with a groan. “Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.”

  
“I didn’t cheat,” said Harry sharply. “It was — a sort of accident
that I found out.”
Moody grinned. “I wasn’t accusing you, laddie. I’ve been telling
Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes,
but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won’t be. They’ll have
told their champions everything they can. They want to win. They
want to beat Dumbledore. They’d like to prove he’s only human.”
Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled
around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.
“So . . . got any ideas how you’re going to get past your dragon
yet?” said Moody.
“No,” said Harry.
“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly. “I don’t
show favoritism, me. I’m just going to give you some good, general
advice. And the first bit is — play to your strengths.”
“I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.
“Excuse me,” growled Moody, “you’ve got strengths if I say
you’ve got them. Think now. What are you best at?”
Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was
easy, really —
“Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help —”
“That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical
eye barely moving at all. “You’re a damn good flier from what I’ve
heard.”
“Yeah, but . . .” Harry stared at him. “I’m not allowed a broom,
I’ve only got my wand —”
“My second piece of general advice,” said Moody loudly, interrupting him, “is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to
get what you need.”

  
Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?
“Come on, boy . . .” whispered Moody. “Put them together . . .
it’s not that difficult. . . .”
And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the
dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Firebolt, he needed —
“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse
three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout
as he passed her. “Hermione — I need you to help me.”
“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.
“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm
properly by tomorrow afternoon.”
And so they practiced. They didn’t have lunch, but headed for a
free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him. He was still having
problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across
the room and dropping like stones to the floor.
“Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .”
“What d’you think I’m trying to do?” said Harry angrily. “A
great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . .
Okay, try again. . . .”
He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione
refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no
point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an
hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling

  
everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that
moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of
sudden, violent deaths.
“Well, that’s good,” said Harry loudly, his temper getting the
better of him, “just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to
suffer.”
Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he
certainly caught Harry’s eye for the first time in days, but Harry
was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest
of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the
table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into
his hand, though he wasn’t entirely sure that was his prowess at
Summoning Charms — perhaps the fly was just stupid.
He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to
the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak
to avoid the teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight.
They would have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started
chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a
hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the
Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace,
surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned
chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in
the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning
Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a

  
spell,” Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione,
so he could try again, “threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He
raised his wand once more. “Accio Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the
room, and Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt’s
going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to
be in the castle, and I’m going to be out there on the grounds. . . .”
“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly “Just as long as
you’re concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d
better get some sleep . . . you’re going to need it.”
Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning
Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had left him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement.
Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get
down to the dragons’ enclosure — though of course, they didn’t
yet know what they would find there.
Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether
they were wishing him good luck or hissing “We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potter ” as he passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn’t just lose his head
when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to
curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he
seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and
the next, walking into lunch . . . and then (where had the morning

  
gone? the last of the dragon-free hours?), Professor McGonagall
was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people were
watching.
“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds
now. . . . You have to get ready for your first task.”
“Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate
with a clatter.
“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “You’ll be fine!”
“Yeah,” said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.
He left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn’t
seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the
cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.
“Now, don’t panic,” she said, “just keep a cool head. . . . We’ve
got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of
hand. . . . The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will
think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all right?”
“Yes,” Harry heard himself say. “Yes, I’m fine.”
She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were,
around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump
of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry
saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.
“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said Professor
McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, “and wait for your
turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there . . . he’ll be telling you the —
the procedure. . . . Good luck.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the
entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.

  
Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool.
She didn’t look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and
clammy. Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry
supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and
down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which
Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard,
as though they had forgotten how to do it.
“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking around at him.
“Come in, come in, make yourself at home!”
Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing
his old Wasp robes again.
“Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in!” said Bagman
brightly. “When the audience has assembled, I’m going to be offering
each of you this bag” — he held up a small sack of purple silk and
shook it at them — “from which you will each select a small model of
the thing you are about to face! There are different — er — varieties,
you see. And I have to tell you something else too . . . ah, yes . . .
your task is to collect the golden egg!”
Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he
understood Bagman’s words, and then started pacing around the
tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum
hadn’t reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if
they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But
they, at least, had volunteered for this. . . .
And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet
could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly,
laughing, joking. . . . Harry felt as separate from the crowd as
though they were a different species. And then — it seemed like

  
about a second later to Harry — Bagman was opening the neck of
the purple silk sack.
“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.
She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon — a Welsh Green. It had the number two
around its neck. And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no
sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had
been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming.
The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese
Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn’t even
blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground.
Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray
Swedish Short-Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled
out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It stretched its
wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs.
“Well, there you are!” said Bagman. “You have each pulled out the
dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which
you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have
to leave you in a moment, because I’m commentating. Mr. Diggory,
you’re first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle,
all right? Now . . . Harry . . . could I have a quick word? Outside?”
“Er . . . yes,” said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of
the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into
the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his
face.
“Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?”
“What?” said Harry. “I — no, nothing.”

  
“Got a plan?” said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially.
“Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them,
you know. I mean,” Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further, “you’re the underdog here, Harry. . . . Anything I can do to
help . . .”
“No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude,
“no — I — I know what I’m going to do, thanks.”
“Nobody would know, Harry,” said Bagman, winking at him.
“No, I’m fine,” said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine. “I’ve
got a plan worked out, I —”
A whistle had blown somewhere.
“Good lord, I’ve got to run!” said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off.
Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it,
greener than ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past,
but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.
Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds later, they
heard the roar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the
enclosure and was now face-to-face with the living counterpart of
his model. . . .
It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there
and listening. The crowd screamed . . . yelled . . . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as Cedric did whatever he was doing to get
past the Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the
ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric’s steps, around
and around the tent. And Bagman’s commentary made everything
much, much worse. . . . Horrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind

  
as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” . . . “He’s taking risks, this one!” . . . “Clever move — pity it didn’t work!”
And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past
his dragon and captured the golden egg.
“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting. “And now the marks
from the judges!”
But he didn’t shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges
were holding them up and showing them to the crowd.
“One down, three to go!” Bagman yelled as the whistle blew
again. “Miss Delacour, if you please!”
Fleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly
toward her than he had done so far as she left the tent with her head
held high and her hand clutching her wand. He and Krum were
left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other’s gaze.
The same process started again. . . . “Oh I’m not sure that was
wise!” they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. “Oh . . . nearly!
Careful now . . . good lord, I thought she’d had it then!”
Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause
once more. . . . Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while
Fleur’s marks were being shown . . . more clapping . . . then, for
the third time, the whistle.
“And here comes Mr. Krum!” cried Bagman, and Krum
slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.
He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of
the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with
fear . . . yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far
away. . . .

  
“Very daring!” Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew
its collective breath. “That’s some nerve he’s showing — and —
yes, he’s got the egg!”
Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had
finished — it would be Harry’s turn any moment.
He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of
marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He
walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a
crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees,
through a gap in the enclosure fence.
He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly
colored dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring
down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he’d
last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end
of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings
half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly,
black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge
marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of
noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn’t know or care. It
was time to do what he had to do . . . to focus his mind, entirely
and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance. . . .
He raised his wand.
“Accio Firebolt!” he shouted.
Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn’t
worked . . . if it wasn’t coming . . . He seemed to be looking at
everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the
hundreds of faces around him swim strangely. . . .

  
And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he
turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge
of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in
midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise. . . . Bagman was shouting something . . . but
Harry’s ears were not working properly anymore . . . listening
wasn’t important. . . .
He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the
ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened. . . .
As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the
crowd’s faces became mere flesh-colored pinpricks below, and the
Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had left not
only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . . He was back where
he belonged. . . .
This was just another Quidditch match, that was all . . . just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly
opposing team. . . .
He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one,
gleaming against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon’s front legs. “Okay,” Harry told himself, “diversionary tactics . . . let’s go. . . .”
He dived. The Horntail’s head followed him; he knew what it
was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire
had been released exactly where he would have been had he not
swerved away . . . but Harry didn’t care . . . that was no more than
dodging a Bludger. . . .
“Great Scott, he can fly!” yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked
and gasped. “Are you watching this, Mr. Krum?”
Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following

  
his progress; its head revolving on its long neck — if he kept this
up, it would be nicely dizzy — but better not push it too long, or
it would be breathing fire again —
Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but
this time he was less lucky — he missed the flames, but the tail
came whipping up to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the
left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes —
He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans
from the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be deep. . . . Now he
zoomed around the back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred
to him. . . .
The Horntail didn’t seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs. Though she writhed and twisted, furling and
unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on
Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them . . . but he had to
persuade her to do it, or he’d never get near them. . . . The trick
was to do it carefully, gradually. . . .
He began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to
make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient
threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him. Her head swayed this
way and that, watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs
bared. . . .
He flew higher. The Horntail’s head rose with him, her neck
now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before
its charmer. . . .
Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation. He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail
thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now. . . . She shot fire
into the air, which he dodged. . . . Her jaws opened wide. . . .

  
“Come on,” Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her,
“come on, come and get me . . . up you get now . . .”
And then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings
at last, as wide as those of a small airplane — and Harry dived.
Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could
go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs —
he had taken his hands off his Firebolt — he had seized the golden
egg —
And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out
over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and
it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up —
for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the
crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish
supporters at the World Cup —
“Look at that!” Bagman was yelling. “Will you look at that! Our
youngest champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to
shorten the odds on Mr. Potter!”
Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the
Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor
McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him,
all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even
from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the
crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his
heart lighter than it had been in weeks. . . . He had got through the
first task, he had survived. . . .
“That was excellent, Potter!” cried Professor McGonagall as he
got off the Firebolt — which from her was extravagant praise. He
noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder. “You’ll

  
need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your
score. . . . Over there, she’s had to mop up Diggory already. . . .”
“Yeh did it, Harry!” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Yeh did it! An’ agains’
the Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie said that was the
wors’ —”
“Thanks, Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn’t
blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons
beforehand.
Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was
dancing in its socket.
“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.
“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please . . .” said Professor
McGonagall.
Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw
Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking
worried.
“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside.
The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s
shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined
Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while. “Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school
next? You’re very lucky . . . this is quite shallow . . . it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though. . . .”
She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that
smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand,
and he felt it heal instantly.
“Now, just sit quietly for a minute — sit! And then you can go
and get your score.”

  
She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and
say, “How does it feel now, Diggory?”
Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He
got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside — Hermione, followed closely by Ron.
“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily. There
were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it
in fear. “You were amazing! You really were!”
But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring
at Harry as though he were a ghost.
“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that
goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to do you in!”
It was as though the last few weeks had never happened — as
though Harry were meeting Ron for the first time, right after he’d
been made champion.
“Caught on, have you?” said Harry coldly. “Took you long
enough.”
Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to
the other. Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron
was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn’t need to
hear it.
“It’s okay,” he said, before Ron could get the words out. “Forget it.”
“No,” said Ron, “I shouldn’t’ve —”
“Forget it,” Harry said.
Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back.
Hermione burst into tears.
“There’s nothing to cry about!” Harry told her, bewildered.
“You two are so stupid!” she shouted, stamping her foot on the

  
ground, tears splashing down her front. Then, before either of
them could stop her, she had given both of them a hug and dashed
away, now positively howling.
“Barking mad,” said Ron, shaking his head. “Harry, c’mon,
they’ll be putting up your scores. . . .”
Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated
than he would have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked
out of the tent, Ron by his side, talking fast.
“You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this
weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground . . . turned
it into a dog . . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog
instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and
it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as
well — the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided
it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away.
And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying
to put it into a trance — well, that kind of worked too, it went all
sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and
her skirt caught fire — she put it out with a bit of water out of her
wand. And Krum — you won’t believe this, but he didn’t even
think of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it
with some sort of spell right in the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took
marks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any damage to them.”
Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure. Now that the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see
where the five judges were sitting — right at the other end, in
raised seats draped in gold.
“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and Harry,

  
squinting up the field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime —
raise her wand in the air. What looked like a long silver ribbon shot
out of it, which twisted itself into a large figure eight.
“Not bad!” said Ron as the crowd applauded. “I suppose she
took marks off for your shoulder. . . .”
Mr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into the air.
“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.
Next, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd was cheering harder than ever.
Ludo Bagman — ten.
“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief. “But . . . I got hurt. . . . What’s
he playing at?”
“Harry, don’t complain!” Ron yelled excitedly.
And now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment,
and then a number shot out of his wand too — four.
“What?” Ron bellowed furiously. “Four? You lousy, biased scumbag, you gave Krum ten!”
But Harry didn’t care, he wouldn’t have cared if Karkaroff had
given him zero; Ron’s indignation on his behalf was worth about a
hundred points to him. He didn’t tell Ron this, of course, but his
heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure. And it
wasn’t just Ron . . . those weren’t only Gryffindors cheering in the
crowd. When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was
facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as
Cedric’s. . . . He didn’t care about the Slytherins, he could stand
whatever they threw at him now.
“You’re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!” said Charlie
Weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the
school. “Listen, I’ve got to run, I’ve got to go and send Mum an

  
owl, I swore I’d tell her what happened — but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah — and they told me to tell you you’ve got to hang
around for a few more minutes. . . . Bagman wants a word, back in
the champions’ tent.”
Ron said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which
somehow looked quite different now: friendly and welcoming. He
thought back to how he’d felt while dodging the Horntail, and
compared it to the long wait before he’d walked out to face it. . . .
There was no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably worse.
Fleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of
Cedric’s face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He grinned at Harry when he saw him.
“Good one, Harry.”
“And you,” said Harry, grinning back.
“Well done, all of you!” said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the
tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got
past a dragon. “Now, just a quick few words. You’ve got a nice long
break before the second task, which will take place at half past nine
on the morning of February the twenty-fourth — but we’re giving
you something to think about in the meantime! If you look down
at those golden eggs you’re all holding, you will see that they
open . . . see the hinges there? You need to solve the clue inside the
egg — because it will tell you what the second task is, and enable
you to prepare for it! All clear? Sure? Well, off you go, then!”
Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back
around the edge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear
what the other champions had done in more detail. Then, as they
rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had first heard the
dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.
It was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the
Quick-Quotes Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.
“Congratulations, Harry!” she said, beaming at him. “I wonder
if you could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that
dragon? How you feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?”
“Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely. “Good-bye.”
And he set off back to the castle with Ron.

C H A P T E R T W E N T Y - O N E
THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT

Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that
evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send
Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his
dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything
Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to
hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected
it all along.
“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said. “Remember what Malfoy said on the
train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know
where they knew each other. They were probably running around
in masks together at the World Cup. . . . I’ll tell you one thing,
though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he’s going to be feeling really stupid now, isn’t he? Didn’t work,
did it? You only got a scratch! Come here — I’ll do it —”
Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was
flying around and around Harry’s head, hooting incessantly. Ron
snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry
attached the letter to his leg.
“There’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?” Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon
to the window. “You know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I’m serious.”
Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same.
Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her
arms, and frowned at Ron.
“Harry’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,” she said seriously. “If that was the first task, I hate to think
what’s coming next.”
“Right little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” said Ron. “You and
Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.”
He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again;
the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than
usual — Harry hadn’t been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-byblow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged
the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, “Well, we’d better get downstairs for your
surprise party, Harry — Fred and George should have nicked
enough food from the kitchens by now.”
Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room
it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains
of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every
surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster’s Fireworks, so that
the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was
very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners,
most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail’s head
on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on
fire.
Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it
was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and
Hermione. He couldn’t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back
on his side, he’d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have
to face the second one for three months.
“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden
egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands.
“Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!”
“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said
swiftly. “It’s in the tournament rules. . . .”
“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my
own too,” Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and
she grinned rather guiltily.
“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed.
Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the
groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.
It was hollow and completely empty — but the moment Harry
opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing,
filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was
the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who
had all been playing the musical saw.
“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.
“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as
Harry slammed it shut again. “Sounded like a banshee. . . . Maybe
you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”
“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who had gone
very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. “You’re going
to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!”
“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George. “They
wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it
sounded a bit like Percy singing . . . maybe you’ve got to attack him
while he’s in the shower, Harry.”
“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.
Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her.
Fred grinned.
“It’s all right,” he said. “I haven’t done anything to them. It’s the
custard creams you’ve got to watch —”
Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and
spat it out. Fred laughed.
“Just my little joke, Neville. . . .”
Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, “Did you get all this
from the kitchens, Fred?”
“Yep,” said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched
squeak and imitated a house-elf. “ ‘Anything we can get you, sir,
anything at all!’ They’re dead helpful . . . get me a roast ox if I said
I was peckish.”
“How do you get in there?” Hermione said in an innocently
casual sort of voice.
“Easy,” said Fred, “concealed door behind a painting of a bowl
of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and —” He stopped and
looked suspiciously at her. “Why?”
“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly.
“Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are
you?” said George. “Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try
and stir them up into rebellion?”
Several people chortled. Hermione didn’t answer.
“Don’t you go upsetting them and telling them they’ve got to
take clothes and salaries!” said Fred warningly “You’ll put them off
their cooking!”
Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a
large canary.
“Oh — sorry, Neville!” Fred shouted over all the laughter. “I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed —”
Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his
feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He
even joined in laughing.
“Canary Creams!” Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. “George
and I invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!”
It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to
the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he
pulled the curtains of his four-poster shut, Harry set his tiny model
of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it
yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he
pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a
point . . . they were all right, really, dragons. . . .
The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty
though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires
and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the
lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing
against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was
likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping
Madame Maxime’s horses well provided with their preferred drink
of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the
corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of
Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they
were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about
them.
“I’m not sure whether they hibernate or not,” Hagrid told the
shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. “Thought
we’d jus’ try an’ see if they fancied a kip . . . we’ll jus’ settle ’em
down in these boxes. . . .”
There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to
kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them
was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor;
their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings
and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the
enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows
and fluffy blankets.
“We’ll jus’ lead ’em in here,” Hagrid said, “an’ put the lids on,
and we’ll see what happens.”
But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid
was soon yelling, “Don’ panic, now, don’ panic!” while the skrewts
rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class — Malfoy, Crabbe,
and Goyle in the lead — had fled into Hagrid’s cabin through the
back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to
help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of
the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally,
only one skrewt was left.
“Don’ frighten him, now!” Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry
used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which
was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering,
over its back. “Jus’ try an’ slip the rope ’round his sting, so he won’
hurt any o’ the others!”
“Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” Ron shouted angrily as he and
Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid’s cabin, still holding the
skrewt off with their sparks.
“Well, well, well . . . this does look like fun.”
Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid’s garden fence, looking in at
the mayhem. She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry
purple collar today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her
arm.
Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was
cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of
its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.
“Who’re you?” Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of
rope around the skrewt’s sting and tightened it.
“Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,” Rita replied, beaming at
him. Her gold teeth glinted.
“Thought Dumbledore said you weren’ allowed inside the
school anymore,” said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the
slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.
Rita acted as though she hadn’t heard what Hagrid had said.
“What are these fascinating creatures called?” she asked, beaming still more widely.
“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” grunted Hagrid.
“Really?” said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. “I’ve never
heard of them before . . . where do they come from?”
Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid’s wild
black beard, and his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts
from? Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said
quickly, “They’re very interesting, aren’t they? Aren’t they, Harry?”
“What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting,” said Harry as she
stepped on his foot.
“Ah, you’re here, Harry!” said Rita Skeeter as she looked around.
“So you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?”
“Yes,” said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.
“Lovely,” said Rita. “Really lovely. Been teaching long?” she
added to Hagrid.
Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut
across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin
windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against
the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.
“This is o’ny me second year,” said Hagrid.
“Lovely. . . I don’t suppose you’d like to give an interview,
would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures?
The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I’m sure
you know. We could feature these — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.”
“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” Hagrid said eagerly. “Er — yeah, why
not?”
Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of
communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had
to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made
arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.
“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as
he set off with Ron and Hermione. “Until Friday night, then,
Hagrid!”
“She’ll twist everything he says,” Harry said under his breath.
“Just as long as he didn’t import those skrewts illegally or anything,” said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another —
it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.
“Hagrid’s been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore’s
never sacked him,” said Ron consolingly. “Worst that can happen
is Hagrid’ll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst?
I meant best.”
Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.
Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon;
they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and
Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny
again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of
them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths,
quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation
of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.
“I would think,” she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, “that some of us” — she stared very
meaningfully at Harry — “might be a little less frivolous had they
seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat
here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its
crystalline depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at
me?”
“An ugly old bat in outsize specs?” Ron muttered under his
breath.
Harry fought hard to keep his face straight.
“Death, my dears.”
Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths,
looking horrified.
“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, “it comes,
ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower . . . ever
lower over the castle. . . .”
She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and
obviously.
“It’d be a bit more impressive if she hadn’t done it about eighty
times before,” Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the
staircase beneath Professor Trelawney’s room. “But if I’d dropped
dead every time she’s told me I’m going to, I’d be a medical
miracle.”
“You’d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,” said Ron,
chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite
direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly. “At least we didn’t get
homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love
not working when she is. . . .”
But Hermione wasn’t at dinner, nor was she in the library when
they went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was
Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while,
watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he
should ask for an autograph — but then Ron realized that six or
seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly
the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
“Wonder where she’s got to?” Ron said as he and Harry went
back to Gryffindor Tower.
“Dunno . . . balderdash.”
But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the
sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione’s arrival.
“Harry!” she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady
stared down at her, eyebrows raised). “Harry, you’ve got to come —
you’ve got to come, the most amazing thing’s happened —
please —”
She seized Harry’s arm and started to try to drag him back along
the corridor.
“What’s the matter?” Harry said.
“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick —”
Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry,
intrigued.
“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with
Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.
“Oh don’t mind me!” the Fat Lady called irritably after them.
“Don’t apologize for bothering me! I’ll just hang here, wide open,
until you get back, shall I?”
“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.
“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after she had led
them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly.
She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward
the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after
the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry
had never been through here before. He and Ron followed
Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in
a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape’s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit
with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were
mainly of food.
“Oh hang on . . .” said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor.
“Wait a minute, Hermione. . . .”
“What?” She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over
her face.
“I know what this is about,” said Harry.
He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind
Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.
“Hermione!” said Ron, cottoning on. “You’re trying to rope us
into that spew stuff again!”
“No, no, I’m not!” she said hastily. “And it’s not spew, Ron —”
“Changed the name, have you?” said Ron, frowning at her.
“What are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I’m not
barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I’m
not doing it —”
“I’m not asking you to!” Hermione said impatiently. “I came
down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found — oh come
on, Harry, I want to show you!”
She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of
the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the
huge green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly
turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled
the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him
inside.
He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room,
large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass
pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him
from the middle of the room, squealing, “Harry Potter, sir! Harry
Potter!”
Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the
squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he
thought his ribs would break.
“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.
“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere
around his navel. “Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see
Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!”
Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at
Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming
with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers
and feet — all except the clothes, which were very different.
When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn
the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the
strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done
an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World
Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned
a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a
bare chest, a pair of what looked like children’s soccer shorts, and
odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had
removed from his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving
Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was covered in pink
and orange stripes.
“Dobby, what’re you doing here?” Harry said in amazement.
“Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!” Dobby squealed
excitedly. “Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs,
sir!”
“Winky?” said Harry. “She’s here too?”
“Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and he seized Harry’s hand and pulled
him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that
stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them,
was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the
Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having
finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden
with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their
counterparts above.
At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen,
beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them.
They were all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with
the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky’s had been, like a toga.
Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed.
“Winky, sir!” he said.
Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had
obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt
and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her
large ears. However, while every one of Dobby’s strange collection
of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brandnew, Winky was plainly not taking care of her clothes at all. There
were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.
“Hello, Winky,” said Harry.
Winky’s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled
out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as
they had done at the Quidditch World Cup.
“Oh dear,” said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry
and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. “Winky, don’t cry, please
don’t . . .”
But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand,
beamed up at Harry.
“Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?” he squeaked loudly, over
Winky’s sobs.
“Er — yeah, okay,” said Harry.
Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him,
bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron,
and Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.
“Good service!” Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione
frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very
low and retreated.
“How long have you been here, Dobby?” Harry asked as Dobby
handed around the tea.
“Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!” said Dobby happily. “Dobby
came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position,
sir, very difficult indeed —”
At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a
nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to
stem the flow.
“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying
to find work!” Dobby squeaked. “But Dobby hasn’t found work,
sir, because Dobby wants paying now!”
The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening
and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as
though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing.
Hermione, however, said, “Good for you, Dobby!”
“Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. “But
most wizards doesn’t want a house-elf who wants paying, miss.
‘That’s not the point of a house-elf,’ they says, and they slammed
the door in Dobby’s face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear
clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. . . . Dobby likes being free!”
The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from
Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky,
however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her crying.
“And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds
out Winky has been freed too, sir!” said Dobby delightedly.
At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and
positively screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down
to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she
said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued with his story,
shouting shrilly over Winky’s screeches.
“And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! ‘Why doesn’t
Dobby and Winky find work together?’ Dobby says. ‘Where is
there enough work for two house-elves?’ says Winky. And Dobby
thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky
came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore
took us on!”
Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes
again.
“And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if
Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby
gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!”
“That’s not very much!” Hermione shouted indignantly from
the floor, over Winky’s continued screaming and fist-beating.
“Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and
weekends off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as
though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening,
“but Dobby beat him down, miss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss,
but he isn’t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”
“And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?”
Hermione asked kindly.
If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly
mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face
sopping wet and suddenly furious.
“Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!” she
squeaked. “Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly
ashamed of being freed!”
“Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But — Winky, come on!
It’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn’t do
anything wrong, he was really horrible to you —”
But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in
her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn’t hear a word, and
screeched, “You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is
right to sack bad Winky!”
“Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,” squeaked
Dobby confidentially. “Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr.
Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she
won’t do it.”
“Can’t house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?”
Harry asked.
“Oh no, sir, no,” said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. “ ’Tis
part of the house-elf’s enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and
our silence, sir. We upholds the family’s honor, and we never speaks
ill of them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does
not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to —
to —”
Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer.
Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, “He said we is free to call
him a — a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!”
Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.
“But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,” he said, talking
normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped.
“Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud
to keep his secrets and our silence for him.”
“But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?” Harry
asked him, grinning.
A slightly fearful look came into Dobby’s immense eyes.
“Dobby — Dobby could,” he said doubtfully. He squared his
small shoulders. “Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards!”
Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by
his own daring — then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, “Bad Dobby! Bad
Dobby!”
Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away
from the table.
“Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,” said Dobby breathlessly,
rubbing his head.
“You just need a bit of practice,” Harry said.
“Practice!” squealed Winky furiously. “You is ought to be
ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!”
“They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby defiantly.
“Dobby doesn’t care what they think anymore!”
“Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!” moaned Winky, tears leaking
down her face once more. “My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing
without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before
me, and my grandmother is doing it before her . . . oh what is they
saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!”
She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.
“Winky,” said Hermione firmly, “I’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We’ve seen him, you know —”
“You is seeing my master?” said Winky breathlessly, raising her
tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at
Hermione. “You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?”
“Yes,” said Hermione, “he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.”
“Mr. Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to Harry’s great
surprise (and Ron’s and Hermione’s too, by the looks on their
faces), she looked angry again. “Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very
bad wizard! My master isn’t liking him, oh no, not at all!”
“Bagman — bad?” said Harry.
“Oh yes,” Winky said, nodding her head furiously. “My master
is telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying . . .
Winky — Winky keeps her master’s secrets. . . .”
She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into
her skirt, “Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no
more!
They couldn’t get another sensible word out of Winky. They left
her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages.
“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!” he said
happily, pointing at his bare chest.
“Tell you what, Dobby,” said Ron, who seemed to have taken a
great liking to the elf, “I’ll give you the one my mum knits me this
Christmas, I always get one from her. You don’t mind maroon, do
you?”
Dobby was delighted.
“We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,” Ron told him, “but
it’ll go well with your tea cozy.”
As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding
elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs.
Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept
bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets
with cream cakes and pies.
“Thanks a lot!” Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered
around the door to say good night. “See you, Dobby!”
“Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?”
Dobby asked tentatively.
“ ’Course you can,” said Harry, and Dobby beamed.
“You know what?” said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had
left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. “All these years I’ve been really impressed with
Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens — well, it’s not
exactly difficult, is it? They can’t wait to give it away!”
“I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those
elves, you know,” said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. “Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves
will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it’ll dawn on them
that they want that too!”
“Let’s hope they don’t look too closely at Winky,” said Harry.
“Oh she’ll cheer up,” said Hermione, though she sounded a bit
doubtful. “Once the shock’s worn off, and she’s got used to Hogwarts, she’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch
man.”
“She seems to love him,” said Ron thickly (he had just started on
a cream cake).
“Doesn’t think much of Bagman, though, does she?” said Harry.
“Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?”
“Probably says he’s not a very good Head of Department,” said
Hermione, “and let’s face it . . . he’s got a point, hasn’t he?”
“I’d still rather work for him than old Crouch,” said Ron. “At
least Bagman’s got a sense of humor.”
“Don’t let Percy hear you saying that,” Hermione said, smiling
slightly.
“Yeah, well, Percy wouldn’t want to work for anyone with a sense
of humor, would he?” said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair.
“Percy wouldn’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him
wearing Dobby’s tea cozy.”

THE UNEXPECTED TASK

Potter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?”
Professor McGonagall’s irritated voice cracked like a whip
through the Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron
both jumped and looked up.
It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the
guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut
away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall’s desk (Neville’s still
had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the
blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches”).
The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who
had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George’s
fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin
parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock.
“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act

their age,” said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the
pair of them as the head of Harry’s haddock drooped and fell
silently to the floor — Ron’s parrot’s beak had severed it moments
before — “I have something to say to you all.
“The Yule Ball is approaching — a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our
foreign guests. Now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and
above — although you may invite a younger student if you
wish —”
Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her
hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to
giggle. They both looked around at Harry. Professor McGonagall
ignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she
had just told off him and Ron.
“Dress robes will be worn,” Professor McGonagall continued,
“and the ball will start at eight o’clock on Christmas Day, finishing
at midnight in the Great Hall. Now then —”
Professor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class.
“The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our
hair down,” she said, in a disapproving voice.
Lavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard
against her mouth to stifle the sound. Harry could see what was
funny this time: Professor McGonagall, with her hair in a tight
bun, looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense.
“But that does NOT mean,” Professor McGonagall went on,
“that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from
Hogwarts students. I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way.”

  
The bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders.
Professor McGonagall called above the noise, “Potter — a word,
if you please.”
Assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber
haddock, Harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher’s desk. Professor
McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then
said, “Potter, the champions and their partners —”
“What partners?” said Harry.
Professor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she
thought he was trying to be funny.
“Your partners for the Yule Ball, Potter,” she said coldly. “Your
dance partners.”
Harry’s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.
“Dance partners?” He felt himself going red. “I don’t dance,” he
said quickly.
“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “That’s
what I’m telling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.”
Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and
tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia
always wore to Uncle Vernon’s work parties.
“I’m not dancing,” he said.
“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly. “You are a
Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a
representative of the school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.”
“But — I don’t —”

  
“You heard me, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall in a very
final sort of way.
A week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance
would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail.
But now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of
asking a girl to the ball, he thought he’d rather have another round
with the dragon.
Harry had never known so many people to put their names
down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course,
because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but
he had always been very much in the minority before now. This
year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be
staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how
many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite
noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors,
girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly
comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas
night. . . .
“Why do they have to move in packs?” Harry asked Ron as a
dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry.
“How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?”
“Lasso one?” Ron suggested. “Got any idea who you’re going to
try?”
Harry didn’t answer. He knew perfectly well whom he’d like to
ask, but working up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a
year older than he was; she was very pretty; she was a very good
Quidditch player, and she was also very popular.

  
Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry’s head.
“Listen, you’re not going to have any trouble. You’re a champion. You’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they’ll be
queuing up to go with you.”
In tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the
bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry’s
amazement, he turned out to be quite right.
A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had
never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very
next day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he’d even
stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather
hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s, and Ron’s taunts
about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two
more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year
who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.
“She was quite good-looking,” said Ron fairly, after he’d stopped
laughing.
“She was a foot taller than me,” said Harry, still unnerved.
“Imagine what I’d look like trying to dance with her.”
Hermione’s words about Krum kept coming back to him. “They
only like him because he’s famous!” Harry doubted very much if
any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have
wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn’t been a school champion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked
him.
On the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely
improved since he had got through the first task. He wasn’t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which

  
he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — he had an idea Cedric
might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude
for Harry’s tip-off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer
Support Cedric Diggory! badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of
course, was still quoting Rita Skeeter’s article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of
it — and just to heighten Harry’s feeling of well-being, no story
about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet.
“She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh
the truth,” Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione asked
him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone during the last
Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term. To their very great
relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now,
and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a
trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to
tempt the skrewts.
“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,” Hagrid continued in a low voice. “Well, I told her we’d been friends since I went
ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys. ‘Never had to tell him off in four
years?’ she said. ‘Never played you up in lessons, has he?’ I told her
no, an’ she didn’ seem happy at all. Yeh’d think she wanted me to
say yeh were horrible, Harry.”
“ ’Course she did,” said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver
into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more.
“She can’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get
boring.”
“She wants a new angle, Hagrid,” said Ron wisely as he shelled
salamander eggs. “You were supposed to say Harry’s a mad delinquent!”

  
“But he’s not!” said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.
“She should’ve interviewed Snape,” said Harry grimly. “He’d
give her the goods on me any day. ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever
since he first arrived at this school. . . .’ ”
“Said that, did he?” said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione
laughed. “Well, yeh might’ve bent a few rules, Harry, bu’ yeh’re all
righ’ really, aren’ you?”
“Cheers, Hagrid,” said Harry, grinning.
“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?” said
Ron.
“Though’ I might look in on it, yeah,” said Hagrid gruffly.
“Should be a good do, I reckon. You’ll be openin’ the dancin’, won’
yeh, Harry? Who’re you takin’?”
“No one, yet,” said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject.
The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere,
though Harry didn’t believe half of them — for instance, that
Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead
from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had
booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters
were Harry didn’t know, never having had access to a wizard’s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had
grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network)
that they were a very famous musical group.
Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying
to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he
allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent
most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm

  
Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament.
Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect
Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes
on goblin rebellions — as Binns hadn’t let his own death stand in
the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like
Christmas wasn’t going to put him off. It was amazing how he
could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as
Percy’s cauldron-bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody
kept them working until the very last second of their classes too,
and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class
than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed
them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the
last lesson of the term.
“Evil, he is,” Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room. “Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last
bit of term with a whole load of studying.”
“Mmm . . . you’re not exactly straining yourself, though, are
you?” said Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions
notes. Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding
Snap pack — a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle
cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at
any second.
“It’s Christmas, Hermione,” said Harry lazily; he was rereading
Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the
fire.
Hermione looked severely over at him too. “I’d have thought
you’d be doing something constructive, Harry, even if you don’t
want to learn your antidotes!”

  
“Like what?” Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.
“That egg!” Hermione hissed.
“Come on, Hermione, I’ve got till February the twenty-fourth,”
Harry said.
He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn’t
opened it since the celebration party after the first task. There were
still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all
the screechy wailing meant, after all.
“But it might take weeks to work it out!” said Hermione. “You’re
going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task
is and you don’t!”
“Leave him alone, Hermione, he’s earned a bit of a break,” said
Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the
whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows.
“Nice look, Ron . . . go well with your dress robes, that will.”
It was Fred and George. They sat down at the table with Harry,
Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.
“Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?” George asked.
“No, he’s off delivering a letter,” said Ron. “Why?”
“Because George wants to invite him to the ball,” said Fred sarcastically.
“Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,” said
George.
“Who d’you two keep writing to, eh?” said Ron.
“Nose out, Ron, or I’ll burn that for you too,” said Fred, waving
his wand threateningly. “So . . . you lot got dates for the ball yet?”
“Nope,” said Ron.

  
“Well, you’d better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be
gone,” said Fred.
“Who’re you going with, then?” said Ron.
“Angelina,” said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.
“What?” said Ron, taken aback. “You’ve already asked her?”
“Good point,” said Fred. He turned his head and called across the
common room, “Oi! Angelina!”
Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the
fire, looked over at him.
“What?” she called back.
“Want to come to the ball with me?”
Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.
“All right, then,” she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.
“There you go,” said Fred to Harry and Ron, “piece of cake.”
He got to his feet, yawning, and said, “We’d better use a school
owl then, George, come on. . . .”
They left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across
the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry.
“We should get a move on, you know . . . ask someone. He’s
right. We don’t want to end up with a pair of trolls.”
Hermione let out a sputter of indignation.
“A pair of . . . what, excuse me?”
“Well — you know,” said Ron, shrugging. “I’d rather go alone
than with — with Eloise Midgen, say.”
“Her acne’s loads better lately — and she’s really nice!”
“Her nose is off-center,” said Ron.
“Oh I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you’re going

  
to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?”
“Er — yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.
“I’m going to bed,” Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls’ staircase without another word.
The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress
the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas. When the decorations went up, Harry noticed that they were the most stunning
he had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve
Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything
from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the
suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite something to hear “O Come, All Ye
Faithful” sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words.
Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside
the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the
songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.
And still, Harry hadn’t asked Cho to the ball. He and Ron were
getting very nervous now, though as Harry pointed out, Ron
would look much less stupid than he would without a partner;
Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other
champions.
“I suppose there’s always Moaning Myrtle,” he said gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls’ toilets on the second
floor.
“Harry — we’ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,” said Ron on

  
Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the
storming of an impregnable fortress. “When we get back to the
common room tonight, we’ll both have partners — agreed?”
“Er . . . okay,” said Harry.
But every time he glimpsed Cho that day — during break, and
then lunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic — she
was surrounded by friends. Didn’t she ever go anywhere alone?
Could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom?
But no — she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five
girls. Yet if he didn’t do it soon, she was bound to have been asked
by somebody else.
He found it hard to concentrate on Snape’s Potions test, and
consequently forgot to add the key ingredient — a bezoar —
meaning that he received bottom marks. He didn’t care, though; he
was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do.
When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.
“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and Hermione, and he
dashed off upstairs.
He’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all. . . . He
hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and
(rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from
a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.
“Er — Cho? Could I have a word with you?”
Giggling should be made illegal, Harry thought furiously, as all
the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn’t, though. She said,
“Okay,” and followed him out of earshot of her classmates.
Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch
as though he had missed a step going downstairs.

  
“Er,” he said.
He couldn’t ask her. He couldn’t. But he had to. Cho stood there
looking puzzled, watching him.
The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue
around them.
“Wangoballwime?”
“Sorry?” said Cho.
“D’you — d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said Harry.
Why did he have to go red now? Why?
“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too. “Oh Harry, I’m really
sorry,” and she truly looked it. “I’ve already said I’ll go with someone else.”
“Oh,” said Harry.
It was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like
snakes, but suddenly he didn’t seem to have any insides at all.
“Oh okay,” he said, “no problem.”
“I’m really sorry,” she said again.
“That’s okay,” said Harry.
They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said,
“Well —”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“Well, ’bye,” said Cho, still very red. She walked away.
Harry called after her, before he could stop himself.
“Who’re you going with?”
“Oh — Cedric,” she said. “Cedric Diggory.”
“Oh right,” said Harry.
His insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been
filled with lead in their absence.
Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up

  
to Gryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in his ears with every step
he took. “Cedric — Cedric Diggory.” He had been starting to quite
like Cedric — prepared to overlook the fact that he had once
beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and
nearly everyone’s favorite champion. Now he suddenly realized
that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn’t have enough
brains to fill an eggcup.
“Fairy lights,” he said dully to the Fat Lady — the password had
been changed the previous day.
“Yes, indeed, dear!” she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair
band as she swung forward to admit him.
Entering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his
surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen-faced in a distant corner. Ginny
was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low,
soothing voice.
“What’s up, Ron?” said Harry, joining them.
Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.
“Why did I do it?” he said wildly. “I don’t know what made me
do it!”
“What?” said Harry.
“He — er — just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with
him,” said Ginny. She looked as though she was fighting back a
smile, but she kept patting Ron’s arm sympathetically.
“You what?” said Harry.
“I don’t know what made me do it!” Ron gasped again. “What
was I playing at? There were people — all around — I’ve gone
mad — everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the entrance hall — she was standing there talking to Diggory — and it
sort of came over me — and I asked her!”

  
Ron moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept talking,
though the words were barely distinguishable.
“She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn’t even
answer. And then — I dunno — I just sort of came to my senses
and ran for it.”
“She’s part veela,” said Harry. “You were right — her grandmother was one. It wasn’t your fault, I bet you just walked past
when she was turning on the old charm for Diggory and got a blast
of it — but she was wasting her time. He’s going with Cho Chang.”
Ron looked up.
“I asked her to go with me just now,” Harry said dully, “and she
told me.”
Ginny had suddenly stopped smiling.
“This is mad,” said Ron. “We’re the only ones left who haven’t
got anyone — well, except Neville. Hey — guess who he asked?
Hermione!”
“What?” said Harry, completely distracted by this startling news.
“Yeah, I know!” said Ron, some of the color coming back into
his face as he started to laugh. “He told me after Potions! Said she’s
always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff —
but she told him she was already going with someone. Ha! As if!
She just didn’t want to go with Neville . . . I mean, who would?”
“Don’t!” said Ginny, annoyed. “Don’t laugh —”
Just then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole.
“Why weren’t you two at dinner?” she said, coming over to join
them.
“Because — oh shut up laughing, you two — because they’ve
both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!” said
Ginny.

  
That shut Harry and Ron up.
“Thanks a bunch, Ginny,” said Ron sourly.
“All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?” said Hermione loftily.
“Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I’m
sure you’ll find someone somewhere who’ll have you.”
But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her
in a whole new light.
“Hermione, Neville’s right — you are a girl. . . .”
“Oh well spotted,” she said acidly.
“Well — you can come with one of us!”
“No, I can’t,” snapped Hermione.
“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners, we’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any, everyone else
has . . .”
“I can’t come with you,” said Hermione, now blushing, “because
I’m already going with someone.”
“No, you’re not!” said Ron. “You just said that to get rid of
Neville!”
“Oh did I?” said Hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously.
“Just because it’s taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn’t mean
no one else has spotted I’m a girl!”
Ron stared at her. Then he grinned again.
“Okay, okay, we know you’re a girl,” he said. “That do? Will you
come now?”
“I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily. “I’m going
with someone else!”
And she stormed off toward the girls’ dormitories again.
“She’s lying,” said Ron flatly, watching her go.
“She’s not,” said Ginny quietly.

  
“Who is it then?” said Ron sharply.
“I’m not telling you, it’s her business,” said Ginny.
“Right,” said Ron, who looked extremely put out, “this is getting
stupid. Ginny, you can go with Harry, and I’ll just —”
“I can’t,” said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. “I’m going
with — with Neville. He asked me when Hermione said no, and I
thought . . . well . . . I’m not going to be able to go otherwise, I’m
not in fourth year.” She looked extremely miserable. “I think I’ll go
and have dinner,” she said, and she got up and walked off to the
portrait hole, her head bowed.
Ron goggled at Harry.
“What’s got into them?” he demanded.
But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through
the portrait hole. The time had come for drastic action.
“Wait here,” he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up
to Parvati, and said, “Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?”
Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.
“Yes, all right then,” she said finally, blushing furiously.
“Thanks,” said Harry, in relief. “Lavender — will you go with
Ron?”
“She’s going with Seamus,” said Parvati, and the pair of them
giggled harder than ever.
Harry sighed.
“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?” he said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn’t hear.
“What about Hermione Granger?” said Parvati.
“She’s going with someone else.”
Parvati looked astonished.

  
“Ooooh — who?” she said keenly.
Harry shrugged. “No idea,” he said. “So what about Ron?”
“Well . . .” said Parvati slowly, “I suppose my sister might . . .
Padma, you know . . . in Ravenclaw. I’ll ask her if you like.”
“Yeah, that would be great,” said Harry. “Let me know, will
you?”
And he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot
more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma
Patil’s nose was dead center.

C H A P T E R T W E N T Y - T H R E E
THE YULE BALL

Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth
years had been given for the holidays, Harry was in no
mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to
Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone
else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during
term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants
were being so much rowdier than usual. Fred and George had had
a great success with their Canary Creams, and for the first couple
of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over
the place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors had learned to
treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case
it had a Canary Cream concealed in the center, and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing
something else. Harry made a mental note never to accept so much
as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn’t forgotten
Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
Snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now.
The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly,
frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid’s cabin, while the Durmstrang ship’s portholes were glazed
with ice, the rigging white with frost. The house-elves down in the
kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming
stews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be
able to find anything to complain about.
“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying
grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron
skulking behind Harry, keen not to be spotted by Fleur). “I will not
fit into my dress robes!”
“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur went out
into the entrance hall. “She really thinks a lot of herself, that one,
doesn’t she?”
“Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron.
He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her
into a response by asking it when she least expected it. However,
Hermione merely frowned and said, “I’m not telling you, you’ll
just make fun of me.”
“You’re joking, Weasley!” said Malfoy, behind them. “You’re not
telling me someone’s asked that to the ball? Not the long-molared
Mudblood?”
Harry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione said
loudly, waving to somebody over Malfoy’s shoulder, “Hello, Professor Moody!”
Malfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around
for Moody, but he was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew.
“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said Hermione
scathingly, and she, Harry, and Ron went up the marble staircase
laughing heartily.
“Hermione,” said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, “your teeth . . .”
“What about them?” she said.
“Well, they’re different . . . I’ve just noticed. . . .”
“Of course they are — did you expect me to keep those fangs
Malfoy gave me?”
“No, I mean, they’re different to how they were before he put
that hex on you. . . . They’re all . . . straight and — and normalsized.”
Hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry
noticed it too: It was a very different smile from the one he
remembered.
“Well . . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them
shrunk, she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they
were back to how they normally were,” she said. “And I just . . . let
her carry on a bit.” She smiled even more widely. “Mum and Dad
won’t be too pleased. I’ve been trying to persuade them to let me
shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my
braces. You know, they’re dentists, they just don’t think teeth and
magic should — look! Pigwidgeon’s back!”
Ron’s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicleladen banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing
him were pointing and laughing, and a group of third-year girls
paused and said, “Oh look at the weeny owl! Isn’t he cute?”
“Stupid little feathery git!” Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs
and snatching up Pigwidgeon. “You bring letters to the addressee!
You don’t hang around showing off!”
Pigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron’s fist.
The third-year girls all looked very shocked.
“Clear off!” Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon, who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through
the air. “Here — take it, Harry,” Ron added in an undertone as the
third-year girls scuttled away looking scandalized. He pulled Sirius’s reply off Pigwidgeon’s leg, Harry pocketed it, and they hurried
back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.
Everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting
off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to.
Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark
window that was gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read
out:
Dear Harry,
Congratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put
your name in that goblet shouldn’t be feeling too happy right
now! I was going to suggest a Conjunctivitis Curse, as a
dragon’s eyes are its weakest point — “That’s what Krum
did!” Hermione whispered — but your way was better, I’m
impressed.
Don’t get complacent, though, Harry. You’ve only done one
task; whoever put you in for the tournament’s got plenty more
opportunity if they’re trying to hurt you. Keep your eyes
open — particularly when the person we discussed is
around — and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.
Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.

  
“He sounds exactly like Moody,” said Harry quietly, tucking the
letter away again inside his robes. “ ‘Constant vigilance!’ You’d
think I walk around with my eyes shut, banging off the walls. . . .”
“But he’s right, Harry,” said Hermione, “you have still got two
tasks to do. You really ought to have a look at that egg, you know,
and start working out what it means. . . .”
“Hermione, he’s got ages!” snapped Ron. “Want a game of chess,
Harry?”
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione’s
face, he said, “Come on, how’m I supposed to concentrate with all
this noise going on? I won’t even be able to hear the egg over this
lot.”
“Oh I suppose not,” she sighed, and she sat down to watch their
chess match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron’s,
involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent
bishop.
Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what
had caused his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes,
and saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back
at him in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose.
“Dobby!” Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he
almost fell out of bed. “Don’t do that!”
“Dobby is sorry, sir!” squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth. “Dobby is only wanting
to wish Harry Potter ‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present,
sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes, sir!”
“It’s okay,” said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual,

  
while his heart rate returned to normal. “Just — just prod me or
something in future, all right, don’t bend over me like that. . . .”
Harry pulled back the curtains around his four-poster, took his
glasses from his bedside table, and put them on. His yell had
awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville. All of them were peering
through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and touslehaired.
“Someone attacking you, Harry?” Seamus asked sleepily.
“No, it’s just Dobby,” Harry muttered. “Go back to sleep.”
“Nah . . . presents!” said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the
foot of his bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were
awake they might as well get down to some present-opening too.
Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously
next to Harry’s bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry.
There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea
cozy.
“Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?” he squeaked
tentatively.
“ ’Course you can,” said Harry. “Er . . . I’ve got something for
you too.”
It was a lie; he hadn’t bought anything for Dobby at all, but he
quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly
rolled-up pair of socks. They were his oldest and foulest, mustard
yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they
were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneakoscope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, “Sorry, I forgot to
wrap them. . . .”
But Dobby was utterly delighted.

  
“Socks are Dobby’s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!” he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon’s. “I has seven
now, sir. . . . But sir . . .” he said, his eyes widening, having pulled
both socks up to their highest extent, so that they reached to the
bottom of his shorts, “they has made a mistake in the shop, Harry
Potter, they is giving you two the same!”
“Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn’t spot that?” said Ron, grinning over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping
paper. “Tell you what, Dobby — here you go — take these two,
and you can mix them up properly. And here’s your sweater.”
He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped,
and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent. Dobby
looked quite overwhelmed.
“Sir is very kind!” he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears
again, bowing deeply to Ron. “Dobby knew sir must be a great
wizard, for he is Harry Potter’s greatest friend, but Dobby did not
know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless —”
“They’re only socks,” said Ron, who had gone slightly pink
around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same.
“Wow, Harry —” He had just opened Harry’s present, a Chudley
Cannon hat. “Cool!” He jammed it onto his head, where it clashed
horribly with his hair.
Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to
be — socks.
“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said happily. “He is
buying the wool out of his wages, sir!”
The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks
upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.
“They’re . . . they’re really . . . well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry,

  
and he pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.
“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas
dinner in the kitchens!” said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye to Ron and the others as he passed.
Harry’s other presents were much more satisfactory than
Dobby’s odd socks — with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’,
which consisted of a single tissue, an all-time low — Harry supposed they too were remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of
Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a
handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any
knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harry’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs,
Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was
also, of course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package, including a new
sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it — Harry supposed
Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of
homemade mince pies.
Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room,
and they went down to breakfast together. They spent most of the
morning in Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their
presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch,
which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage’s Wizarding Crackers.
They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was
untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang
and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione
chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather than

  
join in, and at five o’clock said she was going back upstairs to get
ready for the ball.
“What, you need three hours?” said Ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large
snowball, thrown by George, hit him hard on the side of the head.
“Who’re you going with?” he yelled after Hermione, but she just
waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.
There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so
at seven o’clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend
Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes
of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.
“Lairy fights, that’s the one!” she giggled when they gave the
password, and she swung forward to let them inside.
Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their
dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very selfconscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the
long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There
was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like
a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them
look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs.
It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn’t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly
frayed as the boys set off downstairs.
“I still can’t work out how you two got the best-looking girls in
the year,” muttered Dean.
“Animal magnetism,” said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads
out of his cuffs.

  
The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting
for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in
robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold,
and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to
see that she wasn’t giggling.
“You — er — look nice,” he said awkwardly.
“Thanks,” she said. “Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance
hall,” she added to Ron.
“Right,” said Ron, looking around. “Where’s Hermione?”
Parvati shrugged. “Shall we go down then, Harry?”
“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common
room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the
portrait hole.
The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling
around waiting for eight o’clock, when the doors to the Great Hall
would be thrown open. Those people who were meeting partners
from different Houses were edging through the crowd trying to
find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over
to Harry and Ron.
“Hi,” said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in
robes of bright turquoise. She didn’t look too enthusiastic about
having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed
neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down.
“Hi,” said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the
crowd. “Oh no . . .”
He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur
Delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray
satin, and accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch captain,

  
Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron stood straight
again and stared over the heads of the crowd.
“Where is Hermione?” he said again.
A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon
common room. Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of
black velvet with a high collar, which in Harry’s opinion made him
look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink
was clutching Malfoy’s arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing
green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of them,
Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.
The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the
Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was
at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes
Harry didn’t know. Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn
right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of
grotto full of fairy lights — meaning hundreds of actual living
fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there,
and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.
Then Professor McGonagall’s voice called, “Champions over
here, please!”
Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said “See
you in a minute” to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall,
who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a
rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim of her hat, told them
to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside;
they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the
students had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed

  
themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good
fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his
eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked
away from them so he wouldn’t have to talk to them. His eyes fell
instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.
It was Hermione.
But she didn’t look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and
twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was
wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she
was holding herself differently, somehow — or maybe it was
merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung
over her back. She was also smiling — rather nervously, it was
true — but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more
noticeable than ever; Harry couldn’t understand how he hadn’t
spotted it before.
“Hi, Harry!” she said. “Hi, Parvati!”
Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She
wasn’t the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall
opened, Krum’s fan club from the library stalked past, throwing
Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her
as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn’t seem to be able to
find an insult to throw at her. Ron, however, walked right past
Hermione without looking at her.
Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and
to follow her. They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large
round table at the top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.

  
The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver
frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the
starry black ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, there
were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about
a dozen people.
Harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed
to be enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog
she was putting through its paces. He caught sight of Ron and
Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was watching Hermione
pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was looking sulky.
Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the
top table, but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron’s
as he watched Krum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman,
tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students; and Madame
Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a
flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely. But
Mr. Crouch, Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The fifth seat
at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.
When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy
drew out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry.
Harry took the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing
brand-new, navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.
“I’ve been promoted,” Percy said before Harry could even ask,
and from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as
supreme ruler of the universe. “I’m now Mr. Crouch’s personal assistant, and I’m here representing him.”

  
“Why didn’t he come?” Harry asked. He wasn’t looking forward
to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.
“I’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn’t well, not well at all. Hasn’t
been right since the World Cup. Hardly surprising — overwork.
He’s not as young as he was — though still quite brilliant, of
course, the mind remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup
was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch suffered
a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house-elf of his,
Blinky, or whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but — well, as I say, he’s getting on, he needs
looking after, and I think he’s found a definite drop in his home
comforts since she left. And then we had the tournament to
arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with — that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around — no, poor man, he’s having a
well earned, quiet Christmas. I’m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place.”
Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had
stopped calling Percy “Weatherby” yet, but resisted the temptation.
There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but
small menus were lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his
up uncertainly and looked around — there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down at his own menu, then
said very clearly to his plate, “Pork chops!”
And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table
placed their orders with their plates too. Harry glanced up at
Hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining — surely it meant plenty of extra work for
the house-elves? — but for once, Hermione didn’t seem to be

  
thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with Viktor Krum
and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating.
It now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum
speak before, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.
“Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable,
I am thinking,” he was telling Hermione. “Ve have just four floors,
and the fires are lit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds
larger even than these — though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But in summer ve are flying
every day, over the lakes and the mountains —”
“Now, now, Viktor!” said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn’t
reach his cold eyes, “don’t go giving away anything else, now, or
your charming friend will know exactly where to find us!”
Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. “Igor, all this secrecy . . .
one would almost think you didn’t want visitors.”
“Well, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing
teeth to their fullest extent, “we are all protective of our private
domains, are we not? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us? Are we not right to be proud
that we alone know our school’s secrets, and right to protect them?”
“Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets, Igor,” said Dumbledore amicably. “Only this morning, for
instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and
found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen
before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it.

  
Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may
only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.”
Harry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry
could have sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.
Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to Roger Davies.
“Zis is nothing,” she said dismissively, looking around at the
sparkling walls of the Great Hall. “At ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we
’ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas.
Zey do not melt, of course . . . zey are like ’uge statues of diamond,
glittering around ze place. And ze food is seemply superb. And we
’ave choirs of wood nymphs, ’oo serenade us as we eat. We ’ave
none of zis ugly armor in ze ’alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired
into Beauxbatons, ’e would be expelled like zat.” She slapped her
hand onto the table impatiently.
Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his
face, and he kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the
impression that Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a
word she was saying.
“Absolutely right,” he said quickly, slapping his own hand down
on the table in imitation of Fleur. “Like that. Yeah.”
Harry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the
other staff tables; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and
gazing up at the top table. Harry saw him give a small wave, and
looking around, saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight.
Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he
kept calling her “Hermy-own.”

  
“Her-my-oh-nee,” she said slowly and clearly.
“Herm-own-ninny.”
“Close enough,” she said, catching Harry’s eye and grinning.
When all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up
and asked the students to do the same. Then, with a wave of his
wand, all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor
clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along
the right wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and
some bagpipes were set upon it.
The Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in
black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn. They picked up
their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly
realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and
that the other champions and their partners were standing up.
“Come on!” Parvati hissed. “We’re supposed to dance!”
Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the
brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (he
could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and
next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her
waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.
It wasn’t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought, revolving
slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed
over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them
too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no
longer the center of attention. Neville and Ginny were dancing
nearby — he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod

  
on her feet — and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame
Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat
barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a
woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly
two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his
wooden leg.
“Nice socks, Potter,” Moody growled as he passed, his magical
eye staring through Harry’s robes.
“Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,” said
Harry, grinning.
“He is so creepy!” Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away. “I
don’t think that eye should be allowed !”
Harry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief. The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once
more, and Harry let go of Parvati at once.
“Let’s sit down, shall we?”
“Oh — but — this is a really good one!” Parvati said as the
Weird Sisters struck up a new song, which was much faster.
“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away from
the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so
exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in
fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and Padma were
sitting.
“How’s it going?” Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a
bottle of butterbeer.
Ron didn’t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who
were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs
crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music. Every now and then
she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring

  
her. Parvati sat down on Harry’s other side, crossed her arms and
legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from
Beauxbatons.
“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.
“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.
“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off with the
boy from Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.
Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty chair. She
was a bit pink in the face from dancing.
“Hi,” said Harry. Ron didn’t say anything.
“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand.
“Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.”
Ron gave her a withering look. “Viktor?” he said. “Hasn’t he
asked you to call him Vicky yet?”
Hermione looked at him in surprise. “What’s up with you?” she
said.
“If you don’t know,” said Ron scathingly, “I’m not going to tell
you.”
Hermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.
“Ron, what — ?”
“He’s from Durmstrang!” spat Ron. “He’s competing against
Harry! Against Hogwarts! You — you’re —” Ron was obviously
casting around for words strong enough to describe Hermione’s
crime, “fraternizing with the enemy, that’s what you’re doing!”
Hermione’s mouth fell open.
“Don’t be so stupid!” she said after a moment. “The enemy!
Honestly — who was the one who was all excited when they saw
him arrive? Who was the one who wanted his autograph? Who’s
got a model of him up in their dormitory?”

  
Ron chose to ignore this. “I s’pose he asked you to come with
him while you were both in the library?”
“Yes, he did,” said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks
glowing more brightly. “So what?”
“What happened — trying to get him to join spew, were you?”
“No, I wasn’t! If you really want to know, he — he said he’d been
coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he
hadn’t been able to pluck up the courage!”
Hermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she
was the same color as Parvati’s robes.
“Yeah, well — that’s his story,” said Ron nastily.
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
“Obvious, isn’t it? He’s Karkaroff’s student, isn’t he? He knows
who you hang around with. . . . He’s just trying to get closer to
Harry — get inside information on him — or get near enough to
jinx him —”
Hermione looked as though Ron had slapped her. When she
spoke, her voice quivered.
“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single thing about
Harry, not one —”
Ron changed tack at the speed of light.
“Then he’s hoping you’ll help him find out what his egg means!
I suppose you’ve been putting your heads together during those
cozy little library sessions —”
“I’d never help him work out that egg!” said Hermione, looking
outraged. “Never. How could you say something like that — I want
Harry to win the tournament, Harry knows that, don’t you,
Harry?”
“You’ve got a funny way of showing it,” sneered Ron.

  
“This whole tournament’s supposed to be about getting to know
foreign wizards and making friends with them!” said Hermione
hotly.
“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron. “It’s about winning!”
People were starting to stare at them.
“Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven’t got a problem with
Hermione coming with Krum —”
But Ron ignored Harry too.
“Why don’t you go and find Vicky, he’ll be wondering where
you are,” said Ron.
“Don’t call him Vicky!”
Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance
floor, disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.
“Are you going to ask me to dance at all?” Padma asked him.
“No,” said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.
“Fine,” snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati
and the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to
join them so fast that Harry could have sworn he had zoomed him
there by a Summoning Charm.
“Vare is Herm-own-ninny?” said a voice.
Krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers.
“No idea,” said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. “Lost her, have
you?”
Krum was looking surly again.
“Veil, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,” he said, and he
slouched off.
“Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?”
Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking

  
extremely pompous. “Excellent! That’s the whole point, you
know — international magical cooperation!”
To Harry’s displeasure, Percy now took Padma’s vacated seat.
The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing
with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall;
Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the
dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff
was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor
McGonagall’s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at
which point Fred and George accosted him.
“What do they think they’re doing, annoying senior Ministry
members?” Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously.
“No respect . . .”
Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.
“I hope my brothers weren’t bothering you, Mr. Bagman?” said
Percy at once.
“What? Oh not at all, not at all!” said Bagman. “No, they were
just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing. I’ve promised to
put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko’s
Joke Shop. . . .”
Percy didn’t look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared
to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home. Apparently Fred and George’s plans had grown
even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy
diverted him.

  
“How do you feel the tournament’s going, Mr. Bagman? Our
department’s quite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of
Fire” — he glanced at Harry — “was a little unfortunate, of course,
but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don’t you think?”
“Oh yes,” Bagman said cheerfully, “it’s all been enormous fun.
How’s old Barty doing? Shame he couldn’t come.”
“Oh I’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,” said
Percy importantly, “but in the meantime, I’m more than willing to
take up the slack. Of course, it’s not all attending balls” — he
laughed airily — “oh no, I’ve had to deal with all sorts of things
that have cropped up in his absence — you heard Ali Bashir was
caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country? And then we’ve been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to
sign the International Ban on Dueling. I’ve got a meeting with
their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new year —”
“Let’s go for a walk,” Ron muttered to Harry, “get away from
Percy. . . .”
Pretending they wanted more drinks, Harry and Ron left the
table, edged around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy
lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down
the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by
bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues. Harry
could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. Here
and there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set
off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes, but
they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly
familiar voice.
“. . . don’t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.”

  
“Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening!” Karkaroff’s
voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. “It’s been getting clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned, I can’t deny it —”
“Then flee,” said Snape’s voice curtly. “Flee — I will make your
excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.”
Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his
wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most
ill-natured. Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark
shapes emerged from them.
“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” Snape snarled as a girl
ran past him. “And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!” as a
boy went rushing after her. “And what are you two doing?” he
added, catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead.
Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them
standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he
began winding it around his finger.
“We’re walking,” Ron told Snape shortly. “Not against the law,
is it?”
“Keep walking, then!” Snape snarled, and he brushed past them,
his long black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried
away after Snape. Harry and Ron continued down the path.
“What’s got Karkaroff all worried?” Ron muttered.
“And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?”
said Harry slowly.
They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they
could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench,

  
watching the water in the moonlight. And then Harry heard
Hagrid speak.
“Momen’ I saw yeh, I knew,” he was saying, in an oddly husky
voice.
Harry and Ron froze. This didn’t sound like the sort of scene
they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around,
back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the
shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they
could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and
Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled
Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.
“What did you know, ’Agrid?” said Madame Maxime, a purr in
her low voice.
Harry definitely didn’t want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid
would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly
would have) — if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn’t really an option. Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along
the stone reindeer’s back, but the beetle just wasn’t interesting
enough to block out Hagrid’s next words.
“I jus’ knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother
or yer father?”
“I — I don’t know what you mean, ’Agrid. . . .”
“It was my mother,” said Hagrid quietly. “She was one o’ the las’
ones in Britain. ’Course, I can’ remember her too well . . . she left,
see. When I was abou’ three. She wasn’ really the maternal sort.

  
Well . . . it’s not in their natures, is it? Dunno what happened to
her . . . might be dead fer all I know. . . .”
Madame Maxime didn’t say anything. And Harry, in spite of
himself, took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the
reindeer’s antlers, listening. . . . He had never heard Hagrid talk
about his childhood before.
“Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen’. Tiny little bloke,
my dad was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an’ put him
on top o’ the dresser if he annoyed me. Used ter make him
laugh. . . .” Hagrid’s deep voice broke. Madame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain. “Dad
raised me . . . but he died, o’ course, jus’ after I started school.
Sorta had ter make me own way after that. Dumbledore was a real
help, mind. Very kind ter me, he was. . . .”
Hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his
nose heavily.
“So . . . anyway . . . enough abou’ me. What about you? Which
side you got it on?”
But Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.
“It is chilly,” she said — but whatever the weather was doing, it
was nowhere near as cold as her voice. “I think I will go in now.”
“Eh?” said Hagrid blankly. “No, don’ go! I’ve — I’ve never met
another one before!”
“Anuzzer what, precisely?” said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.
Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood
there in the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he
wouldn’t — but it was no good.
“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.
“ ’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded

  
through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry
heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rosebush. “I ’ave nevair been
more insulted in my life! ’Alf-giant? Moi? I ’ave — I ’ave big bones!”
She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into
the air as she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still
sitting on the bench, staring after her. It was much too dark to
make out his expression. Then, after about a minute, he stood up
and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out into the dark
grounds in the direction of his cabin.
“C’mon,” Harry said, very quietly to Ron. “Let’s go. . . .”
But Ron didn’t move.
“What’s up?” said Harry, looking at him.
Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.
“Did you know?” he whispered. “About Hagrid being half-giant?”
“No,” Harry said, shrugging. “So what?”
He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that
he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world.
Brought up by the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards
took for granted that were revelations to Harry, but these surprises
had become fewer with each successive year. Now, however, he
could tell that most wizards would not have said “So what?” upon
finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.
“I’ll explain inside,” said Ron quietly, “c’mon. . . .”
Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more
private clump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great
Hall. Parvati and Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a
whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more
dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor.

  
“So?” Harry prompted Ron. “What’s the problem with giants?”
“Well, they’re . . . they’re . . .” Ron struggled for words. “. . . not
very nice,” he finished lamely.
“Who cares?” Harry said. “There’s nothing wrong with Hagrid!”
“I know there isn’t, but . . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it
quiet,” Ron said, shaking his head. “I always thought he’d got in
the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn’t like to mention it. . . .”
“But what’s it matter if his mother was a giantess?” said Harry.
“Well . . . no one who knows him will care, ’cos they’ll know
he’s not dangerous,” said Ron slowly. “But . . . Harry, they’re just
vicious, giants. It’s like Hagrid said, it’s in their natures, they’re like
trolls . . . they just like killing, everyone knows that. There aren’t
any left in Britain now, though.”
“What happened to them?”
“Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors. There’re supposed to be giants abroad,
though. . . . They hide out in mountains mostly. . . .”
“I don’t know who Maxime thinks she’s kidding,” Harry said,
watching Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges’ table, looking
very somber. “If Hagrid’s half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones . . .
the only thing that’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.”
Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in
their corner, neither of them having any inclination to dance.
Harry tried not to watch Cho and Cedric too much; it gave him a
strong desire to kick something.
When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone
gave them a last, loud round of applause and started to wend their
way into the entrance hall. Many people were expressing the wish

  
that the ball could have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly
happy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned, the evening
hadn’t been much fun.
Out in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying
good night to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship.
She gave Ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble
staircase without speaking. Harry and Ron followed her, but
halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling him.
“Hey — Harry!”
It was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in
the entrance hall below.
“Yeah?” said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.
Cedric looked as though he didn’t want to say whatever it was in
front of Ron, who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued
to climb the stairs.
“Listen . . .” Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. “I
owe you one for telling me about the dragons. You know that
golden egg? Does yours wail when you open it?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“Well . . . take a bath, okay?”
“What?”
“Take a bath, and — er — take the egg with you, and — er —
just mull things over in the hot water. It’ll help you think. . . . Trust
me.
Harry stared at him.
“Tell you what,” Cedric said, “use the prefects’ bathroom.
Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the
fifth floor. Password’s ‘pine fresh.’ Gotta go . . . want to say good
night —”

  
He grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to
Cho.
Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been
extremely strange advice. Why would a bath help him to work out
what the wailing egg meant? Was Cedric pulling his leg? Was he
trying to make Harry look like a fool, so Cho would like him even
more by comparison?
The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over
the portrait hole. Harry had to yell “Fairy lights!” before he woke
them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated. He
climbed into the common room and found Ron and Hermione
having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing
at each other, each scarlet in the face.
“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t
you?” yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger.
“Oh yeah?” Ron yelled back. “What’s that?”
“Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and
not as a last resort!”
Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as
Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls’ staircase to
bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.
“Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well — that just
proves — completely missed the point —”
Harry didn’t say anything. He liked being back on speaking
terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now — but he
somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.

C H A P T E R T W E N T Y - F O U R
RITA SKEETER’S SCOOP

Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many
yawns punctuating the lazy conversations. Hermione’s hair was
bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal
amounts of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s way
too much bother to do every day,” she said matter-of-factly,
scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.
Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly
to each other, though oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time
in telling Hermione about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn’t seem to
find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as shocking as
Ron did.
“Well, I thought he must be,” she said, shrugging. “I knew he
couldn’t be pure giant because they’re about twenty feet tall. But
  
honestly, all this hysteria about giants. They can’t all be horrible. . . . It’s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward
werewolves. . . . It’s just bigotry, isn’t it?”
Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly,
but perhaps he didn’t want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn’t
looking.
It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected
during the first week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling
rather flat now that Christmas was over — everybody except
Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous.
The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot
closer from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn’t done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up
to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that
this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the
sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had
never heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it
hadn’t. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the
wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg across the
room — though he hadn’t really expected that to help.
Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but
his less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that
he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it
seemed to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a
hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry, had told
Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task — and Cedric’s

  
idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well,
he didn’t need that sort of rubbishy help — not from someone
who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway.
And so the first day of the new term arrived, and Harry set off to
lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual,
but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as
though he were carrying that around with him too.
Snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn’t see
out of them in Herbology. Nobody was looking forward to Care of
Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as Ron said, the
skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing
them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid’s cabin would catch
fire.
When they arrived at Hagrid’s cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent
chin standing before his front door.
“Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,” she barked at
them as they struggled toward her through the snow.
“Who’re you?” said Ron, staring at her. “Where’s Hagrid?”
“My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank,” she said briskly. “I am
your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.”
“Where’s Hagrid?” Harry repeated loudly.
“He is indisposed,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.
Soft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry’s ears. He turned;
Draco Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class.
All of them looked gleeful, and none of them looked surprised to
see Professor Grubbly-Plank.
“This way, please,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode

  
off around the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed her, looking back over
their shoulders at Hagrid’s cabin. All the curtains were closed. Was
Hagrid in there, alone and ill?
“What’s wrong with Hagrid?” Harry said, hurrying to catch up
with Professor Grubbly-Plank.
“Never you mind,” she said as though she thought he was being
nosy.
“I do mind, though,” said Harry hotly. “What’s up with him?”
Professor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn’t hear him.
She led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses
were standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the
edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered.
Many of the girls “ooooohed!” at the sight of the unicorn.
“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown. “How did she
get it? They’re supposed to be really hard to catch!”
The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around
look gray. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden
hooves and throwing back its horned head.
“Boys keep back!” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, throwing
out an arm and catching Harry hard in the chest. “They prefer the
woman’s touch, unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with
care, come on, easy does it. . . .”
She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn,
leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching. The
moment Professor Grubbly-Plank was out of earshot, Harry
turned to Ron.
“What d’you reckon’s wrong with him? You don’t think a
skrewt — ?”

  
“Oh he hasn’t been attacked, Potter, if that’s what you’re thinking,” said Malfoy softly. “No, he’s just too ashamed to show his big,
ugly face.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry sharply.
Malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled
out a folded page of newsprint.
“There you go,” he said. “Hate to break it to you, Potter. . . .”
He smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it,
with Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It
was an article topped with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely
shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never
been afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In
September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-Eye”
Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to
teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision
that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry
of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement
in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks
responsible and kindly when set beside the parthuman Dumbledore employs to teach Care of
Magical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled
from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the

  
position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a
job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over
the headmaster to secure the additional post of
Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads
of many better-qualified candidates.
An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man,
Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to
terrify the students in his care with a succession of
horrific creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind
eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a
series of lessons that many admit to being “very
frightening.”
“I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend
Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,”
says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. “We all
hate Hagrid, but we’re just too scared to say
anything.”
Hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign
of intimidation, however. In conversation with a
Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted
breeding creatures he has dubbed “Blast-Ended
Skrewts,” highly dangerous crosses between manticores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds of
magical creature is, of course, an activity usually
closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid,
however, considers himself to be above such petty
restrictions.

  
“I was just having some fun,” he says, before
hastily changing the subject.
As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has
now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not — as
he has always pretended — a pure-blood wizard.
He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother,
we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the
giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.
Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought
themselves to the point of extinction by warring
amongst themselves during the last century. The
handful that remained joined the ranks of HeWho-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible
for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his
reign of terror.
While many of the giants who served He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not
among them. It is possible she escaped to one of
the giant communities still existing in foreign
mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Fridwulfa’s son appears to have inherited her brutal
nature.
In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have
developed a close friendship with the boy who
brought around You-Know-Who’s fall from
power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother,

  
like the rest of You-Know-Who’s supporters, into
hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus
Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry
Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned
about the dangers of associating with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was
hanging open.
“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.
“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy.
“What’s this rubbish about him” — he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a flobberworm? They haven’t even got teeth!”
Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.
“Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf’s teaching career,” said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. “Half-giant . . . and there was
me thinking he’d just swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was
young. . . . None of the mummies and daddies are going to like
this at all. . . . They’ll be worried he’ll eat their kids, ha, ha. . . .”
“You —”
“Are you paying attention over there?”
Professor Grubbly-Plank’s voice carried over to the boys; the
girls were all clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry
was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he
turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical
properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud
voice, so that the boys could hear too.
“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil when the lesson

  
had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch.
“That’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be
like . . . proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters. . . .”
“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went up the
steps.
“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice. “He can still be
gamekeeper, can’t he?”
Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she
seemed to have had a good time all the same. She was certainly
telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements
to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next
weekend trip.
“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as they entered
the Great Hall. “I didn’t know half the things Professor GrubblyPlank told us about uni —”
“Look at this!” Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet
article under Hermione’s nose.
Hermione’s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron’s.
“How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don’t think
Hagrid told her?”
“No,” said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table
and throwing himself into a chair, furious. “He never even told us,
did he? I reckon she was so mad he wouldn’t give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him back.”
“Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,” said
Hermione quietly.
“We’d have seen her in the garden!” said Ron. “Anyway, she’s not

  
supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore
banned her. . . .”
“Maybe she’s got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry, ladling
chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his
anger. “Sort of thing she’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to
people.”
“Like you and Ron did, you mean,” said Hermione.
“We weren’t trying to hear him!” said Ron indignantly. “We
didn’t have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess
mother where anyone could have heard him!”
“We’ve got to go and see him,” said Harry. “This evening, after
Divination. Tell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?”
he shot at Hermione.
“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a nice change,
having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I
do want Hagrid back, of course I do!” Hermione added hastily,
quailing under Harry’s furious stare.
So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle
once more and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid’s
cabin. They knocked, and Fang’s booming barks answered.
“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry shouted, pounding on the door. “Open
up!
Hagrid didn’t answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the
door, whining, but it didn’t open. They hammered on it for ten
more minutes; Ron even went and banged on one of the windows,
but there was no response.
“What’s he avoiding us for?” Hermione said when they had
finally given up and were walking back to the school. “He surely
doesn’t think we’d care about him being half-giant?”

  
But it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn’t see a sign of him
all week. He didn’t appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn’t
see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.
“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to Harry
whenever there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from
Harry’s retaliation. “Missing the elephant-man?”
There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very surprised that Harry was going to go.
“I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common
room being quiet,” she said. “Really get to work on that egg.”
“Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about
now,” Harry lied.
“Have you really?” said Hermione, looking impressed. “Well
done!”
Harry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He
still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was
ages . . . whereas if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into
Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come back.
He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and
set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they
passed the Durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor
Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming
trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher
than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship,
stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.
“He’s mad!” said Harry, staring at Krum’s dark head as it bobbed
out into the middle of the lake. “It must be freezing, it’s January!”

  
“It’s a lot colder where he comes from,” said Hermione. “I suppose it feels quite warm to him.”
“Yeah, but there’s still the giant squid,” said Ron. He didn’t
sound anxious — if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.
“He’s really nice, you know,” she said. “He’s not at all like you’d
think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he
told me.”
Ron said nothing. He hadn’t mentioned Viktor Krum since the
ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been
snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch
robes.
Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way
down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three
Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of
the shops.
The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at
all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn’t there. Heart sinking, he
went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might
just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after
all.
“Doesn’t he ever go into the office?” Hermione whispered suddenly. “Look!”
She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo
Bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch
of goblins. Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the

  
goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking
rather menacing.
It was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the
Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard
event, and therefore no judging to be done. He watched Bagman
in the mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as strained as he
had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared.
But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood
up.
“In a moment, in a moment!” Harry heard him say brusquely to
the goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry,
his boyish grin back in place.
“Harry!” he said. “How are you? Been hoping to run into you!
Everything going all right?”
“Fine, thanks,” said Harry.
“Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?” said Bagman eagerly. “You couldn’t give us a moment, you two, could you?”
“Er — okay,” said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a
table.
Bagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from
Madam Rosmerta.
“Well, I just thought I’d congratulate you again on your
splendid performance against that Horntail, Harry,” said Bagman.
“Really superb.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, but he knew this couldn’t be all that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in
front of Ron and Hermione. Bagman didn’t seem in any particular
rush to spill the beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the

  
mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching him and
Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.
“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to Harry in an undertone,
noticing Harry watching the goblins too. “Their English isn’t too
good . . . it’s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . . but at least they used sign language another
human could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook . . . and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It
means ‘pickax.’ I don’t like to use it in case they think I’m threatening them.”
He gave a short, booming laugh.
“What do they want?” Harry said, noticing how the goblins
were still watching Bagman very closely.
“Er — well . . .” said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous.
“They . . . er . . . they’re looking for Barry Crouch.”
“Why are they looking for him here?” said Harry. “He’s at the
Ministry in London, isn’t he?”
“Er . . . as a matter of fact, I’ve no idea where he is,” said Bagman. “He’s sort of . . . stopped coming to work. Been absent for a
couple of weeks now. Young Percy, his assistant, says he’s ill. Apparently he’s just been sending instructions in by owl. But would
you mind not mentioning that to anyone, Harry? Because Rita
Skeeter’s still poking around everywhere she can, and I’m willing to
bet she’d work up Barty’s illness into something sinister. Probably
say he’s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins.”
“Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?” Harry asked.
“No,” said Bagman, looking strained again. “I’ve got people
looking, of course . . .” (About time, thought Harry) “and it’s all
very strange. She definitely arrived in Albania, because she met her

  
second cousin there. And then she left the cousin’s house to go
south and see an aunt . . . and she seems to have vanished without
trace en route. Blowed if I can see where she’s got to . . . she doesn’t
seem the type to elope, for instance . . . but still. . . . What are we
doing, talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to
ask you” — he lowered his voice — “how are you getting on with
your golden egg?”
“Er . . . not bad,” Harry said untruthfully.
Bagman seemed to know he wasn’t being honest.
“Listen, Harry,” he said (still in a very low voice), “I feel very
bad about all this . . . you were thrown into this tournament, you
didn’t volunteer for it. . . and if . . .” (his voice was so quiet now,
Harry had to lean closer to listen) “if I can help at all . . . a prod in
the right direction . . . I’ve taken a liking to you . . . the way you
got past that dragon! . . . well, just say the word.”
Harry stared up into Bagman’s round, rosy face and his wide,
baby-blue eyes.
“We’re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren’t we?” he said,
careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of
breaking the rules.
“Well . . . well, yes,” said Bagman impatiently, “but — come
on, Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory, don’t we?”
“Have you offered Cedric help?” Harry said.
The smallest of frowns creased Bagman’s smooth face. “No, I
haven’t,” he said. “I — well, like I say, I’ve taken a liking to you.
Just thought I’d offer . . .”
“Well, thanks,” said Harry, “but I think I’m nearly there with
the egg . . . couple more days should crack it.”

  
He wasn’t entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman’s help, except that Bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his
assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.
Bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn’t say much more as
Fred and George turned up at that point.
“Hello, Mr. Bagman,” said Fred brightly. “Can we buy you a
drink?”
“Er . . . no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at
Harry, “no, thank you, boys . . .”
Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who
was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.
“Well, I must dash,” he said. “Nice seeing you all. Good luck,
Harry.”
He hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs
and exited after him. Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.
“What did he want?” Ron said, the moment Harry had sat
down.
“He offered to help me with the golden egg,” said Harry.
“He shouldn’t be doing that!” said Hermione, looking very
shocked. “He’s one of the judges! And anyway, you’ve already
worked it out — haven’t you?”
“Er . . . nearly,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!” said Hermione, still
looking deeply disapproving. “I hope he’s trying to help Cedric as
much!”
“He’s not, I asked,” said Harry.

  
“Who cares if Diggory’s getting help?” said Ron. Harry privately
agreed.
“Those goblins didn’t look very friendly,” said Hermione, sipping her butterbeer. “What were they doing here?”
“Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,” said Harry. “He’s
still ill. Hasn’t been into work.”
“Maybe Percy’s poisoning him,” said Ron. “Probably thinks if
Crouch snuffs it he’ll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.”
Hermione gave Ron a don’t-joke-about-things-like-that look,
and said, “Funny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They’d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of
Magical Creatures.”
“Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though,” said
Harry. “Maybe they need an interpreter.”
“Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?” Ron asked
Hermione. “Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins?”
“Ha, ha, ha,” said Hermione sarcastically. “Goblins don’t need
protection. Haven’t you been listening to what Professor Binns has
been telling us about goblin rebellions?”
“No,” said Harry and Ron together.
“Well, they’re quite capable of dealing with wizards,” said
Hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer. “They’re very clever.
They’re not like house-elves, who never stick up for themselves.”
“Uh-oh,” said Ron, staring at the door.
Rita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing banana-yellow
robes today; her long nails were painted shocking pink, and she

  
was accompanied by her paunchy photographer. She bought
drinks, and she and the photographer made their way through the
crowds to a table nearby, Harry, Ron, and Hermione glaring at her
as she approached. She was talking fast and looking very satisfied
about something.
“. . . didn’t seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo? Now, why
would that be, do you think? And what’s he doing with a pack of
goblins in tow anyway? Showing them the sights . . . what nonsense . . . he was always a bad liar. Reckon something’s up? Think
we should do a bit of digging? ‘Disgraced Ex-Head of Magical
Games and Sports, Ludo Bagman . . .’ Snappy start to a sentence,
Bozo — we just need to find a story to fit it —”
“Trying to ruin someone else’s life?” said Harry loudly.
A few people looked around. Rita Skeeter’s eyes widened behind
her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.
“Harry!” she said, beaming. “How lovely! Why don’t you come
and join — ?”
“I wouldn’t come near you with a ten-foot broomstick,” said
Harry furiously. “What did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?”
Rita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.
“Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am merely doing
my —”
“Who cares if he’s half-giant?” Harry shouted. “There’s nothing
wrong with him!”
The whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that
the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing.
Rita Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it
back almost at once; she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag,

  
pulled out her Quick-Quotes Quill, and said, “How about giving
me an interview about the Hagrid you know, Harry? The man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind
it. Would you call him a father substitute?”
Hermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer clutched in her
hand as though it were a grenade.
“You horrible woman,” she said, through gritted teeth, “you
don’t care, do you, anything for a story, and anyone will do, won’t
they? Even Ludo Bagman —”
“Sit down, you silly little girl, and don’t talk about things you
don’t understand,” said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as
they fell on Hermione. “I know things about Ludo Bagman that
would make your hair curl . . . not that it needs it —” she added,
eyeing Hermione’s bushy hair.
“Let’s go,” said Hermione, “c’mon, Harry — Ron . . .”
They left; many people were staring at them as they went. Harry
glanced back as they reached the door. Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes
Quill was out; it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of
parchment on the table.
“She’ll be after you next, Hermione,” said Ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.
“Let her try!” said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with
rage. “I’ll show her! Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I’ll get her back for
this. First Harry, then Hagrid . . .”
“You don’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,” said Ron nervously. “I’m serious, Hermione, she’ll dig up something on you —”
“My parents don’t read the Daily Prophet. She can’t scare me into
hiding!” said Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all
Harry and Ron could do to keep up with her. The last time Harry

  
had seen Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy
around the face. “And Hagrid isn’t hiding anymore! He should
never have let that excuse for a human being upset him! Come on!”
Breaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road,
through the gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the
grounds to Hagrid’s cabin.
The curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking
as they approached.
“Hagrid!” Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. “Hagrid, that’s enough! We know you’re in there! Nobody cares if your
mum was a giantess, Hagrid! You can’t let that foul Skeeter woman
do this to you! Hagrid, get out here, you’re just being —”
The door opened. Hermione said, “About t — !” and then
stopped, very suddenly, because she had found herself face-to-face,
not with Hagrid, but with Albus Dumbledore.
“Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.
“We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid,” said Hermione in a
rather small voice.
“Yes, I surmised as much,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling.
“Why don’t you come in?”
“Oh . . . um . . . okay,” said Hermione.
She, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying
to lick his ears. Harry fended off Fang and looked around.
Hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs
of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen,
and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig
of tangled wire.

  
“Hi, Hagrid,” said Harry.
Hagrid looked up.
“ ’Lo,” he said in a very hoarse voice.
“More tea, I think,” said Dumbledore, closing the door behind
Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling
it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes.
Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat
down. There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, “Did
you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?”
Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her
and continued, “Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to
know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down
the door.”
“Of course we still want to know you!” Harry said, staring at
Hagrid. “You don’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry, Professor,” he added quickly, looking at Dumbledore.
“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea what you
said, Harry,” said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring
at the ceiling.
“Er — right,” said Harry sheepishly. “I just meant — Hagrid,
how could you think we’d care what that — woman — wrote
about you?”
Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes and fell
slowly into his tangled beard.
“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling. “I have shown you
the letters from the countless parents who remember you from
their own days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I
sacked you, they would have something to say about it —”

  
“Not all of ’em,” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Not all of ’em wan’ me
ter stay.”
“Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity,
I’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,” said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles. “Not a
week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I
haven’t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it.
But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to
talk to anybody?”
“Yeh — yeh’re not half-giant!” said Hagrid croakily.
“Hagrid, look what I’ve got for relatives!” Harry said furiously.
“Look at the Dursleys!”
“An excellent point,” said Professor Dumbledore. “My own
brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate
charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth
hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his
business as usual! Of course, I’m not entirely sure he can read, so
that may not have been bravery. . . .”
“Come back and teach, Hagrid,” said Hermione quietly, “please
come back, we really miss you.”
Hagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into
his tangled beard.
Dumbledore stood up. “I refuse to accept your resignation,
Hagrid, and I expect you back at work on Monday,” he said. “You
will join me for breakfast at eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all.”
Dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fang’s ears.
When the door had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his

dustbin-lid-sized hands. Hermione kept patting his arm, and at
last, Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, “Great
man, Dumbledore . . . great man . . .”
“Yeah, he is,” said Ron. “Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?”
“Help yerself,” said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his
hand. “Ar, he’s righ’, o’ course — yeh’re all righ’ . . . I bin stupid . . .
my ol’ dad woulda bin ashamed o’ the way I’ve bin behavin’. . . .”
More tears leaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully,
and said, “Never shown you a picture of my old dad, have I?
Here . . .”
Hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and
pulled out a picture of a short wizard with Hagrid’s crinkled black
eyes, beaming as he sat on top of Hagrid’s shoulder. Hagrid was a
good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him,
but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth — he looked
hardly older than eleven.
“Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts,” Hagrid croaked.
“Dad was dead chuffed . . . thought I migh’ not be a wizard, see,
’cos me mum . . . well, anyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at
magic, really . . . but at least he never saw me expelled. Died, see,
in me second year. . . .
“Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went.
Got me the gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives ’em
second chances . . . tha’s what sets him apar’ from other heads, see.
He’ll accept anyone at Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the talent.
Knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren’ . . .
well . . . all tha’ respectable. But some don’ understand that. There’s
some who’d always hold it against yeh . . . there’s some who’d even

  
pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an’ say — I
am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed. ‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’
dad used ter say, ‘there’s some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re
not worth botherin’ with.’ An’ he was right. I’ve bin an idiot. I’m
not botherin’ with her no more, I promise yeh that. Big bones . . .
I’ll give her big bones.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously;
Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk
than admit to Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to
Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware
that he had said anything odd.
“Yeh know wha’, Harry?” he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, “when I firs’ met you, you
reminded me o’ me a bit. Mum an’ Dad gone, an’ you was feelin’
like yeh wouldn’ fit in at Hogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were
really up to it . . . an’ now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!”
He looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously,
“Yeh know what I’d love, Harry? I’d love yeh ter win, I really would.
It’d show ’em all . . . yeh don’ have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh
don’ have ter be ashamed of what yeh are. It’d show ’em Dumbledore’s the one who’s got it righ’, lettin’ anyone in as long as they can
do magic. How you doin’ with that egg, Harry?”
“Great,” said Harry. “Really great.”
Hagrid’s miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile.
“Tha’s my boy . . . you show ’em, Harry, you show ’em. Beat
’em all.”
Lying to Hagrid wasn’t quite like lying to anyone else. Harry
went back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on

  
Hagrid’s whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning the tournament. The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than
ever on Harry’s conscience that evening, and by the time he had
got into bed, he had made up his mind — it was time to shelve his
pride and see if Cedric’s hint was worth anything.

C H A P T E R T W E N T Y - F I V E
THE EGG AND THE EY E

As Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work
out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at
night, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted.
Reluctant though he was to accept more favors from Cedric, he
also decided to use the prefects’ bathroom; far fewer people were
allowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be
disturbed.
Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been
caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the
middle of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the
experience. The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential,
and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take the
Marauder’s Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid
to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and,
most important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as
A

  
minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry
would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak,
crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when
Hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to
open. This time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady
the password (“banana fritters”). “Good luck,” Ron muttered,
climbing into the room as Harry crept out past him.
It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because Harry
had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his
nose with the other. However, the moonlit corridors were empty
and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry
was able to ensure that he wouldn’t run into anyone he wanted to
avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lostlooking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the
right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, “Pine
fresh,” just as Cedric had told him.
The door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door
behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.
His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a
prefect just to be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a
splendid candle-filled chandelier, and everything was made of
white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular
swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred
golden taps stood all around the pool’s edges, each with a differently colored jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving
board. Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile
of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a single goldenframed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who

  
was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered
every time she snored.
Harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off
the walls. Magnificent though the bathroom was — and quite keen
though he was to try out a few of those taps — now he was here he
couldn’t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been
having him on. How on earth was this supposed to help solve the
mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels,
the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-poolsized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.
He could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble
bath mixed with the water, though it wasn’t bubble bath as Harry
had ever experienced it. One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the
size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that Harry
thought it would have supported his weight if he’d cared to test it;
a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water. Harry amused himself for a while turning the taps
on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet
bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs. Then, when the
deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a
very short time considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps,
pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into
the water.
It was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and
treading water, staring at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was
to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-colored
steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him,
no sudden burst of understanding.

  
Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and
opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom,
echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just
as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes. He
snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch,
wondering whether that hadn’t been Cedric’s plan — and then,
making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke.
“I’d try putting it in the water, if I were you.”
Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in
shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glumlooking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was
Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the
S-bend of a toilet three floors below.
“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not wearing
anything!”
The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a
nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one
of the taps ever since he had arrived.
“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said, blinking at him
through her thick spectacles. “You haven’t been to see me for ages.”
“Yeah . . . well . . .” said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to
make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t see anything but his head,
“I’m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? It’s a girls’
one.”
“You didn’t used to care,” said Myrtle miserably. “You used to be
in there all the time.”
This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione
had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew

  
Polyjuice Potion in secret — a forbidden potion that had turned
him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour,
so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.
“I got told off for going in there,” said Harry, which was halftrue; Percy had once caught him coming out of Myrtle’s bathroom.
“I thought I’d better not come back after that.”
“Oh . . . I see . . .” said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in
a morose sort of way. “Well. . . anyway . . . I’d try the egg in the
water. That’s what Cedric Diggory did.”
“Have you been spying on him too?” said Harry indignantly.
“What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?”
“Sometimes,” said Myrtle, rather slyly, “but I’ve never come out
to speak to anyone before.”
“I’m honored,” said Harry darkly. “You keep your eyes shut!”
He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his
waist, and going to retrieve the egg. Once he was back in the water,
Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, “Go on, then . . . open
it under the water!”
Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened
it . . . and this time, it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out
of it, a song whose words he couldn’t distinguish through the water.
“You need to put your head under too,” said Myrtle, who
seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around. “Go on!”
Harry took a great breath and slid under the surface — and now,
sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a
chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands:

  
“Come seek us where our voices sound,
We cannot sing above the ground,
And while you’re searching ponder this:
We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss,
An hour long you’ll have to look,
And to recover what we took,
But past an hour — the prospect’s black,
Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.”
Harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes.
“Hear it?” said Myrtle.
“Yeah . . . ‘Come seek us where our voices sound . . .’ and if I
need persuading . . . hang on, I need to listen again. . . .”
He sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater
renditions of the egg’s song before Harry had it memorized; then
he trod water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and
watched him.
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices
above the ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”
“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from
the day when a dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the
hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry stared around the bathroom,
thinking . . . if the voices could only be heard underwater, then it
made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures. He ran this
theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.
“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there

  
talking to himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the
bubbles had gone. . . .”
“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in
the lake, apart from the giant squid?”
“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don’t have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m
not expecting it. . . .”
Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a
pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet, Harry said, “Well,
does anything in there have a human voice? Hang on —”
Harry’s eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid
on the wall.
“Myrtle, there aren’t merpeople in there, are there?”
“Oooh, very good,” she said, her thick glasses twinkling, “it took
Diggory much longer than that! And that was with her awake
too” — Myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face — “giggling and showing
off and flashing her fins. . . .”
“That’s it, isn’t it?” said Harry excitedly. “The second task’s to go
and find the merpeople in the lake and . . . and . . .”
But he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a
plug in his stomach. He wasn’t a very good swimmer; he’d never
had much practice. Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt
Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry would
drown one day, hadn’t bothered to give him any. A couple of
lengths of this bath were all very well, but that lake was very large,
and very deep . . . and merpeople would surely live right at the
bottom. . . .

  
“Myrtle,” Harry said slowly, “how am I supposed to breathe?”
At this, Myrtle’s eyes filled with sudden tears again.
“Tactless!” she muttered, groping in her robes for a handkerchief.
“What’s tactless?” said Harry, bewildered.
“Talking about breathing in front of me!” she said shrilly, and
her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom. “When I can’t . . .
when I haven’t . . . not for ages . . .”
She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly.
Harry remembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss
about it.
“Sorry,” he said impatiently. “I didn’t mean — I just forgot . . .”
“Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle’s dead,” said Myrtle, gulping,
looking at him out of swollen eyes. “Nobody missed me even when
I was alive. Took them hours and hours to find my body — I know,
I was sitting there waiting for them. Olive Hornby came into the
bathroom — ‘Are you in here again, sulking, Myrtle?’ she said, ‘because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you —’ And then she
saw my body . . . ooooh, she didn’t forget it until her dying day, I
made sure of that . . . followed her around and reminded her, I did.
I remember at her brother’s wedding —”
But Harry wasn’t listening; he was thinking about the merpeople’s song again. “We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss.” That sounded
as though they were going to steal something of his, something he
had to get back. What were they going to take?
“— and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to
stop me stalking her, so I had to come back here and live in my
toilet.”

  
“Good,” said Harry vaguely. “Well, I’m a lot further on than I
was. . . . Shut your eyes again, will you? I’m getting out.”
He retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out,
dried himself, and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again.
“Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?”
Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.
“Er . . . I’ll try,” Harry said, though privately thinking the only
way he’d be visiting Myrtle’s bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked. “See you, Myrtle . . . thanks for your
help.”
“ ’Bye, ’bye,” she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibility Cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap.
Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauder’s Map
to check that the coast was still clear. Yes, the dots belonging to
Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office . . . nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he was
bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above. . . . Harry
had taken his first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught his eye . . . something distinctly odd.
Peeves was not the only thing that was moving. A single dot was
flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner — Snape’s
office. But the dot wasn’t labeled “Severus Snape” . . . it was
Bartemius Crouch.
Harry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to be too ill
to go to work or to come to the Yule Ball — so what was he doing,
sneaking into Hogwarts at one o’clock in the morning? Harry
watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room,
pausing here and there. . . .

  
Harry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got the better of him. He turned and set off in the opposite direction toward
the nearest staircase. He was going to see what Crouch was up to.
Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the
faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a
floorboard, the rustle of his pajamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded
down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him down two
floors. He kept glancing down at the map, wondering . . . It just didn’t seem in character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr. Crouch
to be sneaking around somebody else’s office this late at night. . . .
And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what
he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch, Harry’s leg suddenly sank right through the
trick step Neville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late;
the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass
drum on every step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped — Harry
snatched at it, and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out of his hand
and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee,
he couldn’t reach it.
The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the
staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach —
Pulling the cloak back over himself Harry straightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fear . . . and, almost
immediately —

  
“PEEVES!”
It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker.
Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and
nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury.
“What’s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I’ll have
you, Peeves, I’ll have you, you’ll . . . and what is this?”
Filch’s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and
the wailing stopped — Filch had picked up the egg and closed it.
Harry stood very still, one leg still jammed tightly in the magical
step, listening. Any moment now, Filch was going to pull aside
the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would be no
Peeves . . . but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder’s Map . . . and Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would
show “Harry Potter” standing exactly where he was.
“Egg?” Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. “My sweet!” —
Mrs. Norris was obviously with him — “This is a Triwizard clue!
This belongs to a school champion!”
Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast —
“PEEVES!” Filch roared gleefully. “You’ve been stealing!”
He ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible,
pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to
Filch) deserted staircase.
“Hiding, are you?” he said softly. “I’m coming to get you,
Peeves. . . . You’ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves. . . .
Dumbledore’ll have you out of here for this, you filthy, pilfering
poltergeist. . . .”
Filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-colored cat at
his heels. Mrs. Norris’s lamp-like eyes, so very like her master’s,

  
were fixed directly upon Harry. He had had occasion before now to
wonder whether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats. . . . Sick
with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer in
his old flannel dressing gown — he tried desperately to pull his
trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches — any second now, Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him —
“Filch? What’s going on?”
Filch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of
the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry’s situation
worse: Snape. He was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked
livid.
“It’s Peeves, Professor,” Filch whispered malevolently. “He threw
this egg down the stairs.”
Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch.
Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would
give him away at any second. . . .
“Peeves?” said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch’s hands.
“But Peeves couldn’t get into my office. . . .”
“This egg was in your office, Professor?”
“Of course not,” Snape snapped. “I heard banging and
wailing —”
“Yes, Professor, that was the egg —”
“— I was coming to investigate —”
“— Peeves threw it, Professor —”
“— and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit
and a cupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it!”
“But Peeves couldn’t —”
“I know he couldn’t, Filch!” Snape snapped again. “I seal my office

  
with a spell none but a wizard could break!” Snape looked up the
stairs, straight through Harry, and then down into the corridor below. “I want you to come and help me search for the intruder, Filch.”
“I — yes, Professor — but —”
Filch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who
could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry pleaded with him silently, go with Snape . . .
go . . . Mrs. Norris was peering around Filch’s legs. . . . Harry had
the distinct impression that she could smell him. . . . Why had he
filled that bath with so much perfumed foam?
“The thing is, Professor,” said Filch plaintively, “the headmaster
will have to listen to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a
student, it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle
once and for all —”
“Filch, I don’t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it’s
my office that’s —”
Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.
Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked
down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp
into sight through the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was
wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on
his staff as usual.
“Pajama party, is it?” he growled up the stairs.
“Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,” said Filch at
once. “Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual —
and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into
his off —”
“Shut up!” Snape hissed to Filch.

  
Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw
Moody’s magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably,
onto himself.
Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks . . . he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene:
Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry,
trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody’s lopsided gash of a
mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared
straight into each other’s eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and
turned his blue eye upon Snape again.
“Did I hear that correctly, Snape?” he asked slowly. “Someone
broke into your office?”
“It is unimportant,” said Snape coldly.
“On the contrary,” growled Moody, “it is very important. Who’d
want to break into your office?”
“A student, I daresay,” said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape’s greasy temple. “It has happened before.
Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard . . . students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt. . . .”
“Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?” said Moody.
“Not hiding anything else in your office, are you?”
Harry saw the edge of Snape’s sallow face turn a nasty brick
color, the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly.
“You know I’m hiding nothing, Moody,” he said in a soft and
dangerous voice, “as you’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly
yourself.”
Moody’s face twisted into a smile. “Auror’s privilege, Snape.
Dumbledore told me to keep an eye —”

  
“Dumbledore happens to trust me,” said Snape through
clenched teeth. “I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search
my office!”
“ ’Course Dumbledore trusts you,” growled Moody. “He’s a
trusting man, isn’t he? Believes in second chances. But me — I say
there are spots that don’t come off, Snape. Spots that never come
off, d’you know what I mean?”
Snape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left
forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on
it had hurt him.
Moody laughed. “Get back to bed, Snape.”
“You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!” Snape
hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself. “I have
as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do!”
“Prowl away,” said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. “I
look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time. . . .
You’ve dropped something, by the way. . . .”
With a stab of horror, Harry saw Moody point at the Marauder’s
Map, still lying on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and
Filch both turned to look at it, Harry threw caution to the winds;
he raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody
to attract his attention, mouthing “It’s mine! Mine!”
Snape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning
comprehension on his face —
“Accio Parchment!”
The map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape’s outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into Moody’s hand.
“My mistake,” Moody said calmly. “It’s mine — must’ve
dropped it earlier —”

  
But Snape’s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch’s arms
to the map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting
two and two together, as only Snape could. . . .
“Potter,” he said quietly.
“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and
pocketing it.
“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and
stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment
belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is here!
Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!”
Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to
move up the stairs; Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils
were dilating, trying to sniff Harry out — trapped, Harry leaned
backward, trying to avoid Snape’s fingertips, but any moment
now —
“There’s nothing there, Snape!” barked Moody, “but I’ll be
happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to
Harry Potter!”
“Meaning what?” Snape turned again to look at Moody, his
hands still outstretched, inches from Harry’s chest.
“Meaning that Dumbledore’s very interested to know who’s got
it in for that boy!” said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of
the stairs. “And so am I, Snape . . . very interested. . . .” The torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the
chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever.
Snape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn’t see the
expression on his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape slowly lowered his hands.

  
“I merely thought,” said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, “that if
Potter was wandering around after hours again . . . it’s an unfortunate habit of his . . . he should be stopped. For — for his own safety.”
“Ah, I see,” said Moody softly. “Got Potter’s best interests at
heart, have you?”
There was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each
other. Mrs. Norris gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch’s
legs, looking for the source of Harry’s bubble-bath smell.
“I think I will go back to bed,” Snape said curtly.
“Best idea you’ve had all night,” said Moody. “Now, Filch, if
you’ll just give me that egg —”
“No!” said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son. “Professor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves’ treachery!”
“It’s the property of the champion he stole it from,” said Moody.
“Hand it over, now.”
Snape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another
word. Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared
blankly at Harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very fast, Harry heard Snape
walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and
disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris. “Never
mind, my sweet . . . we’ll see Dumbledore in the morning . . . tell
him what Peeves was up to. . . .”
A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who
placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull clunk on every other step.
“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.
“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.

  
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauders Map
out of his pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to
pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to
water from the pain. “Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you
could help me — ?”
“What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .”
Moody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s leg came
free of the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody
was still gazing at the map.
“Potter . . .” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance,
to see who broke into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I
mean?”
“Er . . . yeah, I did . . .” Harry admitted. “It was Mr. Crouch.”
Moody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map.
He looked suddenly alarmed.
“Crouch?” he said. “You’re — you’re sure, Potter?”
“Positive,” said Harry.
“Well, he’s not here anymore,” said Moody, his eye still whizzing
over the map. “Crouch . . . that’s very — very interesting. . . .”
He said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map.
Harry could tell that this news meant something to Moody and
very much wanted to know what it was. He wondered whether he
dared ask. Moody scared him slightly . . . yet Moody had just
helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. . . .

  
“Er . . . Professor Moody . . . why d’you reckon Mr. Crouch
wanted to look around Snape’s office?”
Moody’s magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon
Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression
that Moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or
not, or how much to tell him.
“Put it this way, Potter,” Moody muttered finally, “they say old
Mad-Eye’s obsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I’m nothing — nothing — compared to Barty Crouch.”
He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know
more.
“Professor Moody?” he said again. “D’you think . . . could this
have anything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there’s
something going on. . . .”
“Like what?” said Moody sharply.
Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn’t want Moody
to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that
might lead to tricky questions about Sirius.
“I don’t know,” Harry muttered, “odd stuff’s been happening
lately, hasn’t it? It’s been in the Daily Prophet . . . the Dark Mark at
the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything. . . .”
Both of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened.
“You’re a sharp boy, Potter,” he said. His magical eye roved back
to the Marauder’s Map. “Crouch could be thinking along those
lines,” he said slowly. “Very possible . . . there have been some
funny rumors flying around lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter,
of course. It’s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.” A grim
smile twisted his lopsided mouth. “Oh if there’s one thing I hate,”
he muttered, more to himself than to Harry, and his magical eye

  
was fixed on the left-hand corner of the map, “it’s a Death Eater
who walked free. . . .”
Harry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry
thought he meant?
“And now I want to ask you a question, Potter,” said Moody in a
more businesslike tone.
Harry’s heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was
going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious
magical object — and the story of how it had fallen into his hands
incriminated not only him, but his own father, Fred and George
Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who braced
himself —
“Can I borrow this?”
“Oh!” said Harry.
He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn’t asking where he’d got it, and
there was no doubt that he owed Moody a favor.
“Yeah, okay.”
“Good boy,” growled Moody. “I can make good use of this . . .
this might be exactly what I’ve been looking for. . . . Right, bed,
Potter, come on, now. . . .”
They climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he
had never seen before. They walked in silence to the door of
Moody’s office, where he stopped and looked up at Harry.
“You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?”
“No,” said Harry, taken aback.
“You want to consider it,” said Moody, nodding and looking
at Harry thoughtfully. “Yes, indeed . . . and incidentally . . . I’m
guessing you weren’t just taking that egg for a walk tonight?”
“Er — no,” said Harry, grinning. “I’ve been working out the
clue.”
Moody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again.
“Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . . . See
you in the morning. . . .”
He went back into his office, staring down at the Marauder’s
Map again, and closed the door behind him.
Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought
about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant. . . . Why was
Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts
when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his
office?
And Moody thought he, Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea . . . but somehow, Harry thought, as he got quietly into
his four-poster ten minutes later, the egg and the cloak now safely
back in his trunk, he thought he’d like to check how scarred the rest
of them were before he chose it as a career.
