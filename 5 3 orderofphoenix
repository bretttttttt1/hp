THE CENTAUR AND THE SNEAK

I’ll bet you wish you hadn’t given up Divination now, don’t you,
Hermione?” asked Parvati, smirking.
It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor
Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and
examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their
first lesson with Firenze that morning.
“Not really,” said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the
Daily Prophet. “I’ve never really liked horses.”
She turned a page of the newspaper, scanning its columns.
“He’s not a horse, he’s a centaur!” said Lavender, sounding shocked.
“A gorgeous centaur . . .” sighed Parvati.
“Either way, he’s still got four legs,” said Hermione coolly. “Anyway, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone?”
“We are!” Lavender assured her. “We went up to her office to see
her, we took her some daffodils — not the honking ones that Sprout’s
got, nice ones. . . .”
“How is she?” asked Harry.
“Not very good, poor thing,” said Lavender sympathetically. “She
I
was crying and saying she’d rather leave the castle forever than stay
here if Umbridge is still here, and I don’t blame her. Umbridge was
horrible to her, wasn’t she?”
“I’ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible,”
said Hermione darkly.
“Impossible,” said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs
and bacon. “She can’t get any worse than she’s been already.”
“You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore
for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,” said Hermione,
closing the newspaper. “Especially another part-human. You saw the
look on her face when she saw Firenze. . . .”
After breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class and
Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the entrance hall,
heading for Divination.
“Aren’t we going up to North Tower?” asked Ron, looking puzzled,
as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase.
Parvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him.
“How d’you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? We’re in classroom eleven now, it was on the notice board yesterday.”
Classroom eleven was situated in the ground-floor corridor leading
off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the Great Hall. Harry
knew it to be one of those classrooms that were never used regularly,
and that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or
storeroom. When he entered it right behind Ron, and found himself right in the middle of a forest clearing, he was therefore momentarily stunned.
“What the — ?”
The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were
growing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and
windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled,
green light. The students who had already arrived were sitting on the
earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders,
arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests,
looking rather nervous. In the middle of the room, where there were
no trees, stood Firenze.
“Harry Potter,” he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered.
“Er — hi,” said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did
not smile. “Er — good to see you . . .”
“And you,” said the centaur, inclining his white-blond head. “It
was foretold that we would meet again.”
Harry noticed that there was the shadow of a hoof-shaped bruise
on Firenze’s chest. As he turned to join the rest of the class upon the
floor, he saw that they were all looking at him with awe, apparently
deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom
they seemed to find intimidating.
When the door was closed and the last student had sat down upon
a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around
the room.
“Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,”
said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, “in imitation of my
natural habitat. I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden
Forest, which was — until Monday — my home . . . but this is not
possible.”
“Please — er — sir —” said Parvati breathlessly, raising her hand,
“why not? We’ve been in there with Hagrid, we’re not frightened!”
“It is not a question of your bravery,” said Firenze, “but of my position. I can no longer return to the forest. My herd has banished me.”
“Herd?” said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she
was thinking of cows. “What — oh!” Comprehension dawned on her
face. “There are more of you?” she said, stunned.
“Did Hagrid breed you, like the thestrals?” asked Dean eagerly.
Firenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to
realize at once that he had said something very offensive.
“I didn’t — I meant — sorry,” he finished in a hushed voice.
“Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,” said
Firenze quietly. There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again.
“Please, sir . . . why have the other centaurs banished you?”
“Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,” said
Firenze. “They see this as a betrayal of our kind.”
Harry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane
had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety upon his
back, calling him a “common mule.” He wondered whether it had
been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.
“Let us begin,” said Firenze. He swished his long palomino tail,
raised his hand toward the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it
slowly, and as he did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they
now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars
emerged upon the ceiling. There were oohs and gasps, and Ron said
audibly, “Blimey!”
“Lie back upon the floor,” said Firenze in his calm voice, “and observe the heavens. Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune
of our races.”
Harry stretched out on his back and gazed upward at the ceiling. A
twinkling red star winked at him from overhead.
“I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their
moons in Astronomy,” said Firenze’s calm voice, “and that you have
mapped the stars’ progress through the heavens. Centaurs have unraveled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings
teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us. . . .”
“Professor Trelawney did Astrology with us!” said Parvati excitedly,
raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay
on her back. “Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that,
and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now” — she drew a right
angle in the air above her — “that means that people need to be extra
careful when handling hot things —”
“That,” said Firenze calmly, “is human nonsense.”
Parvati’s hand fell limply to her side.
“Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,” said Firenze, as his hooves
thudded over the mossy floor. “These are of no more significance than
the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are unaffected by
planetary movements.”
“Professor Trelawney —” began Parvati, in a hurt and indignant
voice.
“— is a human,” said Firenze simply. “And is therefore blinkered
and fettered by the limitations of your kind.”
Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati. She looked very
offended, as did several of the people surrounding her.
“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,” continued
Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up
and down before them, “but she wastes her time, in the main, on the
self-flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling. I, however, am
here to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and impartial. We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are
sometimes marked there. It may take ten years to be sure of what we
are seeing.”
Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry.
“In the past decade, the indications have been that Wizard-kind is
living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars.
Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the
fight must break out again soon. How soon, centaurs may attempt to
divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation
of fume and flame. . . .”
It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did
indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and
Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of
them could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans
were hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to
become competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to
put too much faith in such things anyway, because even centaurs
sometimes read them wrongly. He was nothing like any human
teacher Harry had ever had. His priority did not seem to be to teach
them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing,
not even centaurs’ knowledge, was foolproof.
“He’s not very definite on anything, is he?” said Ron in a low voice,
as they put out their mallowsweet fire. “I mean, I could do with a few
more details about this war we’re about to have, couldn’t you?”
The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone
jumped; Harry had completely forgotten that they were still inside the
castle, quite convinced that he was really in the forest. The class filed
out, looking slightly perplexed; Harry and Ron were on the point of
following them when Firenze called, “Harry Potter, a word, please.”
Harry turned. The centaur advanced a little toward him. Ron
hesitated.
“You may stay,” Firenze told him. “But close the door, please.”
Ron hastened to obey.
“Harry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrid’s, are you not?” said the
centaur.
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Then give him a warning from me. His attempt is not working.
He would do better to abandon it.”
“His attempt is not working?” Harry repeated blankly.
“And he would do better to abandon it,” said Firenze, nodding. “I
would warn Hagrid myself, but I am banished — it would be unwise
for me to go too near the forest now — Hagrid has troubles enough,
without a centaurs’ battle.”
“But — what’s Hagrid attempting to do?” said Harry nervously.
Firenze looked at Harry impassively.
“Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service,” said Firenze,
“and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures. I shall not betray his secret. But he must be brought to
his senses. The attempt is not working. Tell him, Harry Potter. Good
day to you.”
The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since evaporated. As a dull March blurred into a squally
April, his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and
problems again.
Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures
lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze’s warning to Hagrid. At last Harry had managed it by pretending he had lost his copy
of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and doubling back after
class one day. When he passed on Firenze’s message, Hagrid gazed at
him for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken
aback. Then he seemed to pull himself together.
“Nice bloke, Firenze,” he said gruffly, “but he don’ know what he’s
talkin’ abou’ on this. The attemp’s comin’ on fine.”
“Hagrid, what’re you up to?” asked Harry seriously. “Because
you’ve got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and
if you ask me, she’s on a roll. If you’re doing anything you shouldn’t
be —”
“There’s things more importan’ than keepin’ a job,” said Hagrid,
though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl
droppings crashed to the floor. “Don’ worry abou’ me, Harry, jus’ get
along now, there’s a good lad. . . .”
Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all
over his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up
to the castle.
Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding
them, the O.W.L.s were drawing ever nearer. All the fifth years were
suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the
first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she
burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid
to take exams and wanted to leave school now.
If it had not been for the D.A. lessons, Harry thought he would
have been extremely unhappy. He sometimes felt that he was living
for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but
thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as
he looked around at his fellow D.A. members and saw how far they
had come. Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was
going to react when all the members of the D.A. received “Outstanding” in their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.s.
They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had
been very keen to practice, though as Harry kept reminding them,
producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when
they were not under threat was very different to producing it when
confronted by something like a dementor.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement
during their last lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!”
“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect
you,” said Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or something; that’s how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor —”
“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, who was shooting
puffs of silver vapor out of the end of her wand. “And I still —
can’t — do it!” she added angrily.
Neville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip.
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.
“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his
round face was actually shining with sweat.
“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been
brought along to his first ever D.A. meeting by Dean. “Look — ah —
it’s gone. . . . But it was definitely something hairy, Harry!”
Hermione’s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around
her.
“They are sort of nice, aren’t they?” she said, looking at it fondly.
The door of the Room of Requirement opened and then closed
again; Harry looked around to see who had entered, but there did not
seem to be anybody there. It was a few moments before he realized
that the people close to the door had fallen silent. Next thing he knew,
something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee. He
looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the
house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight hats.
“Hi, Dobby!” he said. “What are you — what’s wrong?”
For the elf’s eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking. The
members of the D.A. closest to Harry had fallen silent now: Everybody in the room was watching Dobby. The few Patronuses people
had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room
looking much darker than before.
“Harry Potter, sir . . .” squeaked the elf, trembling from head to
foot, “Harry Potter, sir . . . Dobby has come to warn you . . . but the
house-elves have been warned not to tell . . .”
He ran headfirst at the wall: Harry, who had some experience of
Dobby’s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby
merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats. Hermione
and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy.
“What’s happened, Dobby?” Harry asked, grabbing the elf’s tiny
arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek
to hurt himself.
“Harry Potter . . . she . . . she . . .”
Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist: Harry seized
that too.
“Who’s ‘she,’ Dobby?”
But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce
such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and
mouthed wordlessly.
“Umbridge?” asked Harry, horrified.
Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry’s knees;
Harry held him at bay.
“What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this —
about us — about the D.A.?”
He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by
Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor.
“Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly.
Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the
floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!”
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf.
“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!”
They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the
door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting
along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make
it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just
took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer —
“Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot
of people now fighting to get out.
He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the
queue.
“Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with
the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say
no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the
door behind him.
“Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.
Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast that he
caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished. He started to run right; there was a boys’ bathroom up ahead, he could pretend he’d been in there all the time if he
could just reach it —
“AAARGH!”
Something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly,
skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt. Someone behind him was laughing. He rolled over onto his back and saw
Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase.
“Trip Jinx, Potter!” he said. “Hey, Professor — PROFESSOR! I’ve
got one!”
Umbridge came bustling around the far corner, breathless but
wearing a delighted smile.
“It’s him!” she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. “Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good — fifty points to Slytherin! I’ll
take him from here. . . . Stand up, Potter!”
Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them. He had never seen
Umbridge looking so happy. She seized his arm in a vicelike grip and
turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy. “You hop along and see if you
can round up anymore of them, Draco,” she said. “Tell the others to
look in the library — anybody out of breath — check the bathrooms,
Miss Parkinson can do the girls’ ones — off you go — and you,” she
added in her softest, most dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away.
“You can come with me to the headmaster’s office, Potter.”
They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered
how many of the others had been caught. He thought of Ron — Mrs.
Weasley would kill him — and of how Hermione would feel if she
was expelled before she could take her O.W.L.s. And it had been Seamus’s very first meeting . . . and Neville had been getting so good. . . .
“Fizzing Whizbee,” sang Umbridge, and the stone gargoyle jumped
aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone
staircase. They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but
Umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still
holding tight to Harry.
The office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind his
desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together. Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense.
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was rocking backward and forward on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with
the situation. Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard Harry
did not recognize with very short, wiry hair were positioned on either
side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of
Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy
scroll of parchment in his hands, apparently poised to take notes.
The portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not shamming sleep tonight. All of them were watching what was happening
below, alert and serious. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neighboring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors’ ears.
Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge’s grasp as the door swung
shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of
vicious satisfaction upon his face.
“Well,” he said. “Well, well, well . . .”
Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. His heart
drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear.
“He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Umbridge. There
was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure
Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with
misery in the entrance hall. “The Malfoy boy cornered him.”
“Did he, did he?” said Fudge appreciatively. “I must remember to
tell Lucius. Well, Potter . . . I expect you know why you are here?”
Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant “yes”: His mouth
had opened and the word was half formed when he caught sight of
Dumbledore’s face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry;
his eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder, but as Harry
stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side.
Harry changed direction mid-word.
“Yeh — no.”
“I beg your pardon?” said Fudge.
“No,” said Harry, firmly.
“You don’t know why you are here?”
“No, I don’t,” said Harry.
Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge;
Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another
quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods
and the shadow of a wink.
“So you have no idea,” said Fudge in a voice positively sagging with
sarcasm, “why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office? You
are not aware that you have broken any school rules?”
“School rules?” said Harry. “No.”
“Or Ministry decrees?” amended Fudge angrily.
“Not that I’m aware of,” said Harry blandly.
His heart was still hammering very fast. It was almost worth telling
these lies to watch Fudge’s blood pressure rising, but he could not see
how on earth he would get away with them. If somebody had tipped
off Umbridge about the D.A. then he, the leader, might as well be
packing his trunk right now.
“So it’s news to you, is it,” said Fudge, his voice now thick with
anger, “that an illegal student organization has been discovered within
this school?”
“Yes, it is,” said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent
surprise onto his face.
“I think, Minister,” said Umbridge silkily from beside him, “we
might make better progress if I fetch our informant.”
“Yes, yes, do,” said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at
Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. “There’s nothing like a good
witness, is there, Dumbledore?”
“Nothing at all, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his
head.
There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at
each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. Umbridge
moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho’s curlyhaired friend Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands.
“Don’t be scared, dear, don’t be frightened,” said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her on the back, “it’s quite all right, now. You
have done the right thing. The minister is very pleased with you. He’ll
be telling your mother what a good girl you’ve been. Marietta’s mother,
Minister,” she added, looking up at Fudge, “is Madam Edgecombe
from the Department of Magical Transportation. Floo Network office — she’s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.”
“Jolly good, jolly good!” said Fudge heartily. “Like mother, like
daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don’t be shy, let’s
hear what you’ve got to — galloping gargoyles!”
As Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backward in shock, nearly
landing himself in the fire. He cursed and stamped on the hem of his
cloak, which had started to smoke, and Marietta gave a wail and
pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before the
whole room had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series
of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks
to form the word “SNEAK.”
“Never mind the spots now, dear,” said Umbridge impatiently, “just
take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister —”
But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head
frantically.
“Oh, very well, you silly girl, I’ll tell him,” snapped Umbridge. She
hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said, “Well, Minister,
Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this
evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. She
said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she
admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately at that point this hex,” she waved impatiently at Marietta’s concealed face, “came into operation and upon catching sight of her face
in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.”
“Well, now,” said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently
imagined was a kind and fatherly look. “It is very brave of you, my
dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge, you did exactly the right
thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What
was its purpose? Who was there?”
But Marietta would not speak. She merely shook her head again,
her eyes wide and fearful.
“Haven’t we got a counterjinx for this?” Fudge asked Umbridge
impatiently, gesturing at Marietta’s face. “So she can speak freely?”
“I have not yet managed to find one,” Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione’s jinxing ability.
“But it doesn’t matter if she won’t speak, I can take up the story from
here.
“You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog’s
Head in Hogsmeade —”
“And what is your evidence for that?” cut in Professor McGonagall.
“I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true,
but his hearing was quite unimpaired,” said Umbridge smugly. “He
heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me —”
“Oh, so that’s why he wasn’t prosecuted for setting up all those
regurgitating toilets!” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. “What an interesting insight into our justice system!”
“Blatant corruption!” roared the portrait of the corpulent, rednosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk. “The Ministry
did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!”
“Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,” said Dumbledore softly.
“The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students,” continued
Professor Umbridge, “was to persuade them to join an illegal society,
whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are
inappropriate for school-age —”
“I think you’ll find you’re wrong there, Dolores,” said Dumbledore
quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway
down his crooked nose.
Harry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going
to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard
every word he said in the Hog’s Head there was simply no escaping it.
“Oho!” said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet
again. “Yes, do let’s hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull
Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on — Willy
Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter’s identical twin in the
Hog’s Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of
invisible dementors?”
Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.
“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!”
Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment,
that Dumbledore was smiling gently too.
“Cornelius, I do not deny — and nor, I am sure, does Harry —
that he was in the Hog’s Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely
pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group
was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry decree ban-
ning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after
Harry’s Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules in the
Hog’s Head at all.”
Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something
very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth
hanging open.
Umbridge recovered first.
“That’s all very fine, Headmaster,” she said, smiling sweetly. “But
we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational
Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all
those that have happened since most certainly are.”
“Well,” said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over
the top of his interlocked fingers, “they certainly would be, if they had
continued after the decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence
that these meetings continued?”
As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather
thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that
he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a
draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.
“Evidence?” repeated Umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike
smile. “Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think
Miss Edgecombe is here?”
“Oh, can she tell us about six months’ worth of meetings?” said
Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows. “I was under the impression that
she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.”
“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these
meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your
head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?”
Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they
had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would
be able to shift aside. . . .
“Just nod or shake your head, dear,” Umbridge said coaxingly to
Marietta. “Come on, now, that won’t activate the jinx further. . . .”
Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face. Only
her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe.
Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank.
And then — to Harry’s utter amazement — Marietta shook her head.
Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.
“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m asking whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six
months? You have, haven’t you?”
Again, Marietta shook her head.
“What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?” said Umbridge
in a testy voice.
“I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,” said Professor
McGonagall harshly. “There have been no secret meetings for the past
six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?”
Marietta nodded.
“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously.
“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the
Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter
organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl?”
“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall
coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of
sign language as yet unknown to humans —”
Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her,
and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was
on his feet, his wand raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge
leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they
had been burned.
“I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,” said
Dumbledore, and for the first time, he looked angry.
“You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,” said Kingsley in
his deep, slow voice. “You don’t want to get yourself into trouble
now.”
“No,” said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. “I mean, yes — you’re right, Shacklebolt — I — I
forgot myself.”
Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her.
She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor relieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly
blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley’s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him
sprang into Harry’s mind.
“Dolores,” said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something
once and for all, “the meeting tonight — the one we know definitely
happened —”
“Yes,” said Umbridge, pulling herself together, “yes . . . well, Miss
Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh
floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch
those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were forewarned
of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor
they were running in every direction. It does not matter, however. I
have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind. . . . We
needed evidence and the room provided . . .”
And to Harry’s horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of
names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement’s wall
and handed it to Fudge.
“The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were
dealing with,” she said softly.
“Excellent,” said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face. “Excellent, Dolores. And . . . by thunder . . .”
He looked up at Dumbledore, who was still standing beside Marietta, his wand held loosely in his hand.
“See what they’ve named themselves?” said Fudge quietly. “Dumbledore’s Army.”
Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from
Fudge. He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak. Then he looked up,
smiling.
“Well, the game is up,” he said simply. “Would you like a written
confession from me, Cornelius — or will a statement before these
witnesses suffice?”
Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other. There was
fear in both faces. He did not understand what was going on, and neither, apparently, did Fudge.
“Statement?” said Fudge slowly. “What — I don’t — ?”
“Dumbledore’s Army, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, still smiling as
he waved the list of names before Fudge’s face. “Not Potter’s Army.
Dumbledore’s Army.”
“But — but —”
Understanding blazed suddenly in Fudge’s face. He took a horrified
step backward, yelped, and jumped out of the fire again.
“You?” he whispered, stamping again on his smoldering cloak.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
“You organized this?”
“I did,” said Dumbledore.
“You recruited these students for — for your army?”
“Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,” said Dumbledore,
nodding. “Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining
me. I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe, of
course.”
Marietta nodded. Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore, his chest
swelling.
“Then you have been plotting against me!” he yelled.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore cheerfully.
“NO!” shouted Harry.
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him, McGonagall widened
her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned upon Harry what
Dumbledore was about to do, and he could not let it happen.
“No — Professor Dumbledore!”
“Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,”
said Dumbledore calmly.
“Yes, shut up, Potter!” barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight. “Well, well, well — I came here
tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead —”
“Instead you get to arrest me,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It’s like
losing a Knut and finding a Galleon, isn’t it?”
“Weasley!” cried Fudge, now positively quivering with delight,
“Weasley, have you written it all down, everything he’s said, his confession, have you got it?”
“Yes, sir, I think so, sir!” said Percy eagerly, whose nose was splattered with ink from the speed of his note-taking.
“The bit about how he’s been trying to build up an army against
the Ministry, how he’s been working to destabilize me?”
“Yes, sir, I’ve got it, yes!” said Percy, scanning his notes joyfully.
“Very well, then,” said Fudge, now radiant with glee. “Duplicate
your notes, Weasley, and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once. If
we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition!” Percy
dashed from the room, slamming the door behind him, and Fudge
turned back to Dumbledore. “You will now be escorted back to the
Ministry, where you will be formally charged and then sent to Azkaban to await trial!”
“Ah,” said Dumbledore gently, “yes. Yes, I thought we might hit
that little snag.”
“Snag?” said Fudge, his voice still vibrating with joy. “I see no snag,
Dumbledore!”
“Well,” said Dumbledore apologetically, “I’m afraid I do.”
“Oh really?”
“Well — it’s just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion
that I am going to — what is the phrase? ‘Come quietly’ I am afraid I
am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius. I have absolutely no
intention of being sent to Azkaban. I could break out, of course —
but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of
things I would rather be doing.”
Umbridge’s face was growing steadily redder, she looked as though
she was being filled with boiling water. Fudge stared at Dumbledore
with a very silly expression on his face, as though he had just been
stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened. He made a small choking noise and then looked around at
Kingsley and the man with short gray hair, who alone of everyone in
the room had remained entirely silent so far. The latter gave Fudge a
reassuring nod and moved forward a little, away from the wall. Harry
saw his hand drift, almost casually, toward his pocket.
“Don’t be silly, Dawlish,” said Dumbledore kindly. “I’m sure you
are an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved ‘Outstanding’ in all your N.E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to — er — ‘bring
me in’ by force, I will have to hurt you.”
The man called Dawlish blinked, looking rather foolish. He looked
toward Fudge again, but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to
what to do next.
“So,” sneered Fudge, recovering himself, “you intend to take on
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself single-handed, do you,
Dumbledore?”
“Merlin’s beard, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “Not unless you
are foolish enough to force me to.”
“He will not be single-handed!” said Professor McGonagall loudly,
plunging her hand inside her robes.
“Oh yes he will, Minerva!” said Dumbledore sharply. “Hogwarts
needs you!”
“Enough of this rubbish!” said Fudge, pulling out his own wand.
“Dawlish! Shacklebolt! Take him!”
A streak of silver light flashed around the room. There was a bang
like a gunshot, and the floor trembled. A hand grabbed the scruff of
Harry’s neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash
went off — several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched, and a
cloud of dust filled the air. Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him. There was a shriek
and a thud and somebody cried, “No!” Then the sound of breaking
glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan — and silence.
Harry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him and saw
Professor McGonagall crouched beside him. She had forced both him
and Marietta out of harm’s way. Dust was still floating gently down
through the air onto them. Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall figure moving toward them.
“Are you all right?” said Dumbledore.
“Yes!” said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry
and Marietta with her.
The dust was clearing. The wreckage of the office loomed into
view: Dumbledore’s desk had been overturned, all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor, their silver instruments in pieces.
Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley, and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor.
Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them, singing softly.
“Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked
very suspicious,” said Dumbledore in a low voice. “He was remarkably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss Edgecombe’s memory like
that while everyone was looking the other way — thank him for me,
won’t you, Minerva?
“Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do
not know that we had time to communicate — you must act as though
no time has passed, as though they were merely knocked to the
ground, they will not remember —”
“Where will you go, Dumbledore?” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Grimmauld Place?”
“Oh no,” said Dumbledore with a grim smile. “I am not leaving to
go into hiding. Fudge will soon wish he’d never dislodged me from
Hogwarts, I promise you. . . .”
“Professor Dumbledore . . .” Harry began.
He did not know what to say first: how sorry he was that he had
started the D.A. in the first place and caused all this trouble, or how
terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion? But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word.
“Listen to me, Harry,” he said urgently, “you must study Occlumency as hard as you can, do you understand me? Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before
sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams — you will
understand why soon enough, but you must promise me —”
The man called Dawlish was stirring. Dumbledore seized Harry’s
wrist.
“Remember — close your mind —”
But as Dumbledore’s fingers closed over Harry’s skin, a pain shot
through the scar on his forehead, and he felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him —
“— you will understand,” whispered Dumbledore.
Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him. Dumbledore
released Harry, raised his hand, and grasped the phoenix’s long golden
tail. There was a flash of fire and the pair of them had gone.
“Where is he?” yelled Fudge, pushing himself up from the ground.
“Where is he?”
“I don’t know!” shouted Kingsley, also leaping to his feet.
“Well, he can’t have Disapparated!” cried Umbridge. “You can’t inside this school —”
“The stairs!” cried Dawlish, and he flung himself upon the door,
wrenched it open, and disappeared, followed closely by Kingsley and
Umbridge. Fudge hesitated, then got to his feet slowly, brushing dust
from his front. There was a long and painful silence.
“Well, Minerva,” said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirtsleeve, “I’m afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore.”
“You think so, do you?” said Professor McGonagall scornfully.
Fudge seemed not to hear her. He was looking around at the
wrecked office. A few of the portraits hissed at him; one or two even
made rude hand gestures.
“You’d better get those two off to bed,” said Fudge, looking back at
Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod toward Harry and
Marietta.
She said nothing, but marched Harry and Marietta to the door. As
it swung closed behind them, Harry heard Phineas Nigellus’s voice.
“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts
. . . but you cannot deny he’s got style. . . .”

SNAPE’S WORST MEMORY

— by order of —
The Ministry of Magic
Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry.
The above is in accordance with
Educational Decree Number Twenty-eight.
Signed:
minister of magic
The notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did
not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know
that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the
Minister of Magic, and his Junior Assistant to escape. No matter
where Harry went within the castle next day, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore’s flight, and though some of the details might
have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl
assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungo’s with a
pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the rest of their
information was. Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that Harry
and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in
Dumbledore’s office, and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing,
Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a firsthand account wherever he went.
“Dumbledore will be back before long,” said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to
Harry’s story. “They couldn’t keep him away in our second year and
they won’t be able to this time. The Fat Friar told me . . .” He dropped
his voice conspiratorially, so that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to
lean closer to him to hear, “. . . that Umbridge tried to get back into his
office last night after they’d searched the castle and grounds for him.
Couldn’t get past the gargoyle. The Head’s office has sealed itself against
her.” Ernie smirked. “Apparently she had a right little tantrum. . . .”
“Oh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head’s
office,” said Hermione viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into
the entrance hall. “Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid
puffed-up, power-crazy old —”
“Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?”
Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door, followed by
Crabbe and Goyle. His pale, pointed face was alight with malice.
“Afraid I’m going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and
Hufflepuff,” he drawled.
“It’s only teachers that can dock points from Houses, Malfoy,” said
Ernie at once.
“Yeah, we’re prefects too, remember?” snarled Ron.
“I know prefects can’t dock points, Weasel King,” sneered Malfoy;
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. “But members of the Inquisitorial
Squad —”
“The what?” said Hermione sharply.
“The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,” said Malfoy, pointing toward a
tiny silver I upon his robes just beneath his prefect’s badge. “A select
group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, handpicked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial
Squad do have the power to dock points. . . . So, Granger, I’ll have five
from you for being rude about our new headmistress. . . . Macmillan,
five for contradicting me. . . . Five because I don’t like you, Potter . . .
Weasley, your shirt’s untucked, so I’ll have another five for that. . . . Oh
yeah, I forgot, you’re a Mudblood, Granger, so ten for that. . . .”
Ron pulled out his wand, but Hermione pushed it away, whispering, “Don’t!”
“Wise move, Granger,” breathed Malfoy. “New Head, new times
. . . Be good now, Potty . . . Weasel King . . .”
He strode away, laughing heartily with Crabbe and Goyle.
“He was bluffing,” said Ernie, looking appalled. “He can’t be allowed to dock points . . . that would be ridiculous. . . . It would completely undermine the prefect system. . . .”
But Harry, Ron, and Hermione had turned automatically toward
the giant hourglasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which
recorded the House points. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck
and neck in the lead that morning. Even as they watched, stones flew
upward, reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs. In fact, the only
glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of Slytherin.
“Noticed, have you?” said Fred’s voice.
He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie in front of the hourglasses.
“Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,” said Harry furiously,
as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor
hourglass.
“Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break,” said George.
“What do you mean, ‘tried’?” said Ron quickly.
“He never managed to get all the words out,” said Fred, “due to the
fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the
first floor.”
Hermione looked very shocked.
“But you’ll get into terrible trouble!”
“Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I
dunno where we sent him,” said Fred coolly. “Anyway . . . we’ve decided we don’t care about getting into trouble anymore.”
“Have you ever?” asked Hermione.
“ ’Course we have,” said George. “Never been expelled, have we?”
“We’ve always known where to draw the line,” said Fred.
“We might have put a toe across it occasionally,” said George.
“But we’ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem,” said
Fred.
“But now?” said Ron tentatively.
“Well, now —” said George.
“— what with Dumbledore gone —” said Fred.
“— we reckon a bit of mayhem —” said George.
“— is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,” said Fred.
“You mustn’t!” whispered Hermione. “You really mustn’t! She’d
love a reason to expel you!”
“You don’t get it, Hermione, do you?” said Fred, smiling at her.
“We don’t care about staying anymore. We’d walk out right now if we
weren’t determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first. So anyway,” he
checked his watch, “phase one is about to begin. I’d get in the Great
Hall for lunch if I were you, that way the teachers will see you can’t
have had anything to do with it.”
“Anything to do with what?” said Hermione anxiously.
“You’ll see,” said George. “Run along, now.”
Fred and George turned away and disappeared in the swelling
crowd descending the stairs toward lunch. Looking highly disconcerted, Ernie muttered something about unfinished Transfiguration
homework and scurried away.
“I think we should get out of here, you know,” said Hermione nervously. “Just in case . . .”
“Yeah, all right,” said Ron, and the three of them moved toward the
doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had barely glimpsed today’s ceiling
of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and, turning, he found himself almost nose to nose with Filch, the
caretaker. He took several hasty steps backward; Filch was best viewed
at a distance.
“The headmistress would like to see you, Potter,” he leered.
“I didn’t do it,” said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and
George were planning. Filch’s jowls wobbled with silent laughter.
“Guilty conscience, eh?” he wheezed. “Follow me. . . .”
Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione, who were both looking
worried. He shrugged and followed Filch back into the entrance hall,
against the tide of hungry students.
Filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase. As they
reached the first landing he said, “Things are changing around here,
Potter.”
“I’ve noticed,” said Harry coldly.
“Yerse . . . I’ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he’s too
soft with you all,” said Filch, chuckling nastily. “You filthy little beasts
would never have dropped Stinkpellets if you’d known I had it in my
power to whip you raw, would you, now? Nobody would have
thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could’ve
strung you up by the ankles in my office, would they? But when Educational Decree Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, I’ll be allowed to do
them things. . . . And she’s asked the Minister to sign an order for the
expulsion of Peeves. . . . Oh, things are going to be very different
around here with her in charge. . . .”
Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her
side, Harry thought, and the worst of it was that he would probably
prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school’s secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley
twins.
“Here we are,” he said, leering down at Harry as he rapped three
times upon Professor Umbridge’s door and pushed it open. “The Potter boy to see you, ma’am.”
Umbridge’s office, so very familiar to Harry from his many detentions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying
across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word
HEADMISTRESS; also his Firebolt, and Fred’s and George’s Cleansweeps, which he saw with a pang were now chained and padlocked to
a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk. Umbridge was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling upon some of her pink parchment,
but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance.
“Thank you, Argus,” she said sweetly.
“Not at all, ma’am, not at all,” said Filch, bowing as low as his
rheumatism would permit, and exiting backward.
“Sit,” said Umbridge curtly, pointing toward a chair, and Harry sat.
She continued to scribble for a few moments. He watched some of the
foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her head, wondering
what fresh horror she had in store for him.
“Well now,” she said finally, setting down her quill and looking
like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. “What would you
like to drink?”
“What?” said Harry, quite sure he had misheard her.
“To drink, Mr. Potter,” she said, smiling still more widely. “Tea?
Coffee? Pumpkin juice?”
As she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave, and a
cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk.
“Nothing, thank you,” said Harry.
“I wish you to have a drink with me,” she said, her voice becoming
more dangerously sweet. “Choose one.”
“Fine . . . tea then,” said Harry, shrugging.
She got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her
back to him. She then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in sinisterly sweet fashion.
“There,” she said, handing it to him. “Drink it before it gets cold,
won’t you? Well, now, Mr. Potter . . . I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night.”
He said nothing. She settled herself back into her seat and waited.
When several long moments had passed in silence, she said gaily,
“You’re not drinking up!”
He raised the cup to his lips and then, just as suddenly, lowered it.
One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round
blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody’s magical one, and it had just occurred to Harry what Mad-Eye would say if he ever heard that Harry
had drunk anything offered by a known enemy.
“What’s the matter?” said Umbridge, who was still watching him.
“Do you want sugar?”
“No,” said Harry.
He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip,
though keeping his mouth tightly closed. Umbridge’s smile widened.
“Good,” she whispered. “Very good. Now then . . .” She leaned
forward a little. “Where is Albus Dumbledore?”
“No idea,” said Harry promptly.
“Drink up, drink up,” she said, still smiling. “Now, Mr. Potter, let
us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone.
You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning.
Consider your position, Mr. Potter. . . .”
“I don’t know where he is.”
Harry pretended to drink again.
“Very well,” said Umbridge, looking displeased. “In that case, you
will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.”
Harry’s stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup
shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer. He tilted the cup to his
mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid
trickled down onto his robes.
“I don’t know,” he said a little too quickly.
“Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, “let me remind you that it was I who
almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I
know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any
proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat,
Mr. Potter . . . Where is Sirius Black?”
“No idea,” said Harry loudly. “Haven’t got a clue.”
They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering.
Then she stood up.
“Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be
warned: The might of the Ministry stands behind me. All channels of
communication in and out of this school are being monitored. A Floo
Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts —
except my own, of course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and
reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. And Mr. Filch is
observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred
of evidence . . .”
BOOM!
The very floor of the office shook; Umbridge slipped sideways,
clutching her desk for support, looking shocked.
“What was — ?”
She was gazing toward the door; Harry took the opportunity to
empty his almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers.
He could hear people running and screaming several floors below.
“Back to lunch with you, Potter!” cried Umbridge, raising her
wand and dashing out of the office. Harry gave her a few seconds’ start
then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was.
It was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned.
Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what
seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks.
Dragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring
up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as
they went. Shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were
whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers. Rockets
with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls.
Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a
halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and
momentum the longer he watched.
Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed with horror, halfway down the stairs. As Harry watched, one of the larger
Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more
room to maneuver; it whirled toward Umbridge and Filch with a sinister wheeeeeeeeee. Both adults yelled with fright and ducked and it
soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the
grounds. Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that
was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end
of the corridor to escape toward the second floor.
“Hurry, Filch, hurry!” shrieked Umbridge. “They’ll be all over the
school unless we do something — Stupefy!”
A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the
rockets. Instead of freezing in midair, it exploded with such force that
it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle
of a meadow — she ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later
squashed into the painting next door, where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her.
“Don’t Stun them, Filch!” shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the
world as though it had been his suggestion.
“Right you are, Headmistress!” wheezed Filch, who was a Squib
and could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them.
He dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom, and began swatting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom
was ablaze.
Harry had seen enough. Laughing, he ducked down low, ran to a
door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the
corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just
behind it, listening to Umbridge’s and Filch’s yells and quaking with
suppressed mirth.
“Impressive,” Harry said quietly, grinning. “Very impressive . . .
You’ll put Dr. Filibuster out of business, no problem. . . .”
“Cheers,” whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face.
“Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing them next. . . . They multiply by ten
every time you try. . . .”
The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school
that afternoon. Though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly
the firecrackers, the other teachers did not seem to mind them very
much.
“Dear, dear,” said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the
dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame. “Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our
classroom?”
The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the
summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid
their rooms of the fireworks without her. When the final bell rang and
the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags,
Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a disheveled and soot-blackened
Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick’s classroom.
“Thank you so much, Professor!” said Professor Flitwick in his
squeaky little voice. “I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of
course, but I wasn’t sure whether I had the authority. . . .”
Beaming, he closed his classroom door in her snarling face.
Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common
room. Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd
around them to congratulate them.
“They were wonderful fireworks,” she said admiringly.
“Thanks,” said George, looking both surprised and pleased.
“Weasleys’ Wildfire Whiz-Bangs. Only thing is, we used our whole
stock, we’re going to have to start again from scratch now. . . .”
“It was worth it, though,” said Fred, who was taking orders from
clamoring Gryffindors. “If you want to add your name to the waiting
list, Hermione, it’s five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty
for the Deflagration Deluxe. . . .”
Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting
staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework might
spring out of it and start doing itself.
“Oh, why don’t we have a night off?” said Hermione brightly, as a
silver-tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window. “After all, the
Easter holidays start on Friday, we’ll have plenty of time then. . . .”
“Are you feeling all right?” Ron asked, staring at her in disbelief.
“Now you mention it,” said Hermione happily, “d’you know . . . I
think I’m feeling a bit . . . rebellious.”
Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when
he and Ron went up to bed an hour later, and as he got undressed a
sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word
POO.
He got into bed, yawning. With his glasses off, the occasional firework still passing the window became blurred, looking like sparkling
clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky. He turned
onto his side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first
day in Dumbledore’s job, and how Fudge would react when he heard
that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption. . . . Smiling to himself, he closed his eyes. . . .
The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed
to be growing more distant . . . or perhaps he, Harry, was simply
speeding away from them. . . .
He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of
Mysteries. He was speeding toward the plain black door. . . . Let it
open. . . . Let it open. . . .
It did. He was inside the circular room lined with doors. . . . He
crossed it, placed his hand upon an identical door, and it swung
inward. . . .
Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd, mechanical
clicking. There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did
not pause to investigate. . . . He had to go on. . . .
There was a door at the far end. . . . It too opened at his touch. . . .
And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church,
full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden
with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres. . . . Now Harry’s heart was
beating fast with excitement. . . . He knew where to go. . . . He ran
forward, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted
room. . . .
There was something in this room he wanted very, very much. . . .
Something he wanted. . . . or somebody else wanted. . . .
His scar was hurting. . . .
BANG! Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter.
“Cool!” said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window.
“I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it’s like they
mated, come and see!”
Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look.
He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him. He felt as though a wonderful treat
had been snatched from him at the very last moment. . . . He had got
so close that time. . . .
Glittering, pink-and-silver winged piglets were now soaring past
the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His
stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening. . . .
Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going
to say if he found out how much farther into the Department of Mysteries he had penetrated during his last dream. With a surge of guilt he
realized that he had not practiced Occlumency once since their last
lesson: There had been too much going on since Dumbledore had
left. He was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even
if he had tried. He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept
that excuse. . . .
He attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day,
but it was no good, Hermione kept asking him what was wrong
whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while
teachers were firing review questions at the class.
Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape’s office after dinner.
Halfway across the entrance hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to
him.
“Over here,” said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting
with Snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall
where the giant hourglasses stood. Gryffindor’s was now almost
empty. “Are you okay? Umbridge hasn’t been asking you about the
D.A., has she?”
“Oh no,” said Cho hurriedly. “No, it was only . . . Well, I just
wanted to say . . . Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell. . . .”
“Yeah, well,” said Harry moodily. He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully. It was small consolation that the
last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and
Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples.
“She’s a lovely person really,” said Cho. “She just made a
mistake —”
Harry looked at her incredulously.
“A lovely person who made a mistake? She sold us all out, including
you!”
“Well . . . we all got away, didn’t we?” said Cho pleadingly. “You
know, her mum works for the Ministry, it’s really difficult for her —”
“Ron’s dad works for the Ministry too!” Harry said furiously. “And
in case you hadn’t noticed, he hasn’t got ‘sneak’ written across his
face —”
“That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger’s,” said Cho
fiercely. “She should have told us she’d jinxed that list —”
“I think it was a brilliant idea,” said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and
her eyes grew brighter.
“Oh yes, I forgot — of course, if it was darling Hermione’s idea —”
“Don’t start crying again,” said Harry warningly.
“I wasn’t going to!” she shouted.
“Yeah . . . well . . . good,” he said. “I’ve got enough to cope with at
the moment.”
“Go and cope with it then!” she said furiously, turning on her heel
and stalking off.
Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape’s dungeon, and
though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for
Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things he should
have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.
“You’re late, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him.
Snape was standing with his back to Harry, removing, as usual, certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore’s Pensieve. He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and
turned to face Harry.
“So,” he said. “Have you been practicing?”
“Yes,” Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape’s
desk.
“Well, we’ll soon find out, won’t we?” said Snape smoothly. “Wand
out, Potter.”
Harry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk
between them. His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and
anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind.
“On the count of three then,” said Snape lazily. “One — two —”
Snape’s office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in.
“Professor Snape, sir — oh — sorry —”
Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.
“It’s all right, Draco,” said Snape, lowering his wand. “Potter is here
for a little Remedial Potions.”
Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had
turned up to inspect Hagrid.
“I didn’t know,” he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was
burning. He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the
truth at Malfoy — or, even better, to hit him with a good curse.
“Well, Draco, what is it?” asked Snape.
“It’s Professor Umbridge, sir — she needs your help,” said Malfoy.
“They’ve found Montague, sir. He’s turned up jammed inside a toilet
on the fourth floor.”
“How did he get in there?” demanded Snape.
“I don’t know, sir, he’s a bit confused. . . .”
“Very well, very well — Potter,” said Snape, “we shall resume this
lesson tomorrow evening instead.”
He turned and swept from his office. Malfoy mouthed “Remedial
Potions?” at Harry behind Snape’s back before following him.
Seething, Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to
leave the room. At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to
practice; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape,
though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the
whole school that he needed Remedial Potions. . . .
He was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light
dancing on the door frame. He stopped, looking at it, reminded of
something. . . . Then he remembered: It was a little like the lights he
had seen in his dream last night, the lights in the second room he had
walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries.
He turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting
on Snape’s desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling
within. Snape’s thoughts . . . things he did not want Harry to see if he
broke through Snape’s defenses accidentally. . . .
Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him. . . . What
was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry?
The silvery lights shivered on the wall. . . . Harry took two steps toward the desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about
the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from
him?
Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and
faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague
from the toilet? Would he come straight back to his office afterward,
or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter . . .
Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape
would want to make sure he was all right. . . .
Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over
it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his
wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely
silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end
of his wand.
The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned forward over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once
again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling. . . . In fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was
looking down upon the Great Hall. . . .
His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape’s thoughts. . . .
His brain seemed to be in limbo. . . . It would be insane to do the
thing that he was so strongly tempted to do. . . . He was trembling.
. . . Snape could be back at any moment . . . but Harry thought of
Cho’s anger, of Malfoy’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.
He took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface
of Snape’s thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping
Harry headfirst into the Pensieve. . . .
He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he
went, and then —
He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four
House tables were gone. Instead there were more than a hundred
smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student,
head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was
the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted
their parchment. It was clearly exam time.
Sunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent
heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light.
Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere. . . .
This was his memory. . . .
And there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared.
Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant
kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping onto
the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the
parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and
read the heading of the examination paper:
defense against the dark arts —
ordinary wizarding level
So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry’s own age. His
hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot
more than his closest neighbors, and yet his writing was minuscule
and cramped.
“Five more minutes!”
The voice made Harry jump; turning, he saw the top of Professor
Flitwick’s head moving between the desks a short distance away. Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair . . . very
untidy black hair. . . .
Harry moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have
knocked desks flying. Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across
two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy’s head
drew nearer and nearer. . . . He was straightening up now, putting
down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment toward him so as to
reread what he had written. . . .
Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteenyear-old father.
Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: It was as though he
was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James’s eyes were
hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry’s, and there was no scar
on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same
eyebrows. James’s hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry’s did, his
hands could have been Harry’s, and Harry could tell that when James
stood up, they would be within an inch of each other’s heights.
James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even
messier than it had been. Then, with a glance toward Professor
Flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats
behind him.
With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the
thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back
on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes
with a sort of casual elegance neither James’s nor Harry’s could ever
have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully,
though he didn’t seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this
girl — Harry’s stomach gave another pleasurable squirm — was Remus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: As he reread his answers
he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.
So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere too . . .
and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousyhaired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was
chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground
with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbor’s paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at
James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had
drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L. E. What did they
stand for?
“Quills down, please!” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “That means
you too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parchment! Accio!”
More than a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and
into Professor Flitwick’s outstretched arms, knocking him backward
off his feet. Several people laughed. A couple of students at the front
desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows, and
lifted him onto his feet again.
“Thank you . . . thank you,” panted Professor Flitwick. “Very well,
everybody, you’re free to go!”
Harry looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the
L. E. he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill
and the exam question paper into his bag, which he slung over his
back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him.
Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables toward the doors into the entrance hall, still
absorbed in his own examination paper. Round-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, his oily hair
swinging about his face.
A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James and Sirius,
and by planting himself in the midst of this group, Harry managed to
keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of
James and his friends.
“Did you like question ten, Moony?” asked Sirius as they emerged
into the entrance hall.
“Loved it,” said Lupin briskly. “ ‘Give five signs that identify the
werewolf.’ Excellent question.”
“D’you think you managed to get all the signs?” said James in tones
of mock concern.
“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds.
“One: He’s sitting on my chair. Two: He’s wearing my clothes. Three:
His name’s Remus Lupin . . .”
Wormtail was the only one who didn’t laugh.
“I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes, and the tufted tail,”
he said anxiously, “but I couldn’t think what else —”
“How thick are you, Wormtail?” said James impatiently. “You run
round with a werewolf once a month —”
“Keep your voice down,” implored Lupin.
Harry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close
by, still buried in his examination questions; but this was Snape’s
memory, and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a
different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not
be able to follow James any farther. To his intense relief, however,
when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn toward the
lake, Snape followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with
no fixed idea of where he was going. By jogging a little ahead of him,
Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.
“Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,” he heard Sirius say.
“I’ll be surprised if I don’t get Outstanding on it at least.”
“Me too,” said James. He put his hand in his pocket and took out
a struggling Golden Snitch.
“Where’d you get that?”
“Nicked it,” said James casually. He started playing with the Snitch,
allowing it to fly as much as a foot away and seizing it again; his reflexes were excellent. Wormtail watched him in awe.
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge
of the lake where Harry, Ron, and Hermione had spent a Sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass.
Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight,
that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadows of a
clump of bushes. He was as deeply immersed in the O.W.L. paper as
ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech
and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree.
The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the
bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great
Hall were sitting with shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the
water.
Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around
at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and
bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the
Snitch, letting it zoom farther and farther away, almost escaping but
always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with
his mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch,
Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry
wondered why James didn’t tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but
James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed his father
had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not
get too tidy, and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the water’s edge.
“Put that away, will you?” said Sirius finally, as James made a fine
catch and Wormtail let out a cheer. “Before Wormtail wets himself
from excitement.”
Wormtail turned slightly pink but James grinned.
“If it bothers you,” he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket.
Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for
whom James would have stopped showing off.
“I’m bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.”
“You might,” said Lupin darkly from behind his book. “We’ve still
got Transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me. . . . Here.” He
held out his book.
Sirius snorted. “I don’t need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.”
“This’ll liven you up, Padfoot,” said James quietly. “Look who it
is. . . .”
Sirius’s head turned. He had become very still, like a dog that has
scented a rabbit.
“Excellent,” he said softly. “Snivellus.”
Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at.
Snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L. paper in
his bag. As he emerged from the shadows of the bushes and set off
across the grass, Sirius and James stood up. Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at his book, though his
eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his
eyebrows. Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with
a look of avid anticipation on his face.
“All right, Snivellus?” said James loudly.
Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack: Dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes, and his
wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, “Expelliarmus!”
Snape’s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud
in the grass behind him. Sirius let out a bark of laughter.
“Impedimenta!” he said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was
knocked off his feet, halfway through a dive toward his own fallen
wand.
Students all around had turned to watch. Some of them had gotten
to their feet and were edging nearer to watch. Some looked apprehensive, others entertained.
Snape lay panting on the ground. James and Sirius advanced on
him, wands up, James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the water’s edge as he went. Wormtail was on his feet now, watching hungrily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view.
“How’d the exam go, Snivelly?” said James.
“I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,” said
Sirius viciously. “There’ll be great grease marks all over it, they won’t
be able to read a word.”
Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular.
Wormtail sniggered shrilly. Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx
was still operating on him; he was struggling, as though bound by invisible ropes.
“You — wait,” he panted, staring up at James with an expression of
purest loathing. “You — wait. . . .”
“Wait for what?” said Sirius coolly. “What’re you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?”
Snape let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but his
wand being ten feet away nothing happened.
“Wash out your mouth,” said James coldly. “Scourgify!”
Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape’s mouth at once; the froth
was covering his lips, making him gag, choking him —
“Leave him ALONE!”
James and Sirius looked around. James’s free hand jumped to his
hair again.
It was one of the girls from the lake edge. She had thick, dark red
hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green almond-shaped
eyes — Harry’s eyes.
Harry’s mother . . .
“All right, Evans?” said James, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature.
“Leave him alone,” Lily repeated. She was looking at James with
every sign of great dislike. “What’s he done to you?”
“Well,” said James, appearing to deliberate the point, “it’s more the
fact that he exists, if you know what I mean. . . .”
Many of the surrounding watchers laughed, Sirius and Wormtail
included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn’t, and
neither did Lily.
“You think you’re funny,” she said coldly. “But you’re just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him alone.”
“I will if you go out with me, Evans,” said James quickly. “Go on
. . . Go out with me, and I’ll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.”
Behind him, the Impediment Jinx was wearing off. Snape was beginning to inch toward his fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he
crawled.
“I wouldn’t go out with you if it was a choice between you and the
giant squid,” said Lily.
“Bad luck, Prongs,” said Sirius briskly, turning back to Snape. “OY!”
But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there
was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James’s face,
spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about; a second flash of
light later, Snape was hanging upside down in the air, his robes falling
over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying
underpants.
Many people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James,
and Wormtail roared with laughter.
Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as
though she was going to smile, said, “Let him down!”
“Certainly,” said James and he jerked his wand upward. Snape fell
into a crumpled heap on the ground. Disentangling himself from his
robes, he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, “Petrificus
Totalus!” and Snape keeled over again at once, rigid as a board.
“LEAVE HIM ALONE!” Lily shouted. She had her own wand out
now. James and Sirius eyed it warily.
“Ah, Evans, don’t make me hex you,” said James earnestly.
“Take the curse off him, then!”
James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the
countercurse.
“There you go,” he said, as Snape struggled to his feet again, “you’re
lucky Evans was here, Snivellus —”
“I don’t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!”
Lily blinked. “Fine,” she said coolly. “I won’t bother in future. And
I’d wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.”
“Apologize to Evans!” James roared at Snape, his wand pointed
threateningly at him.
“I don’t want you to make him apologize,” Lily shouted, rounding
on James. “You’re as bad as he is. . . .”
“What?” yelped James. “I’d NEVER call you a — you-know-what!”
“Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like
you’ve just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid
Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you
just because you can — I’m surprised your broomstick can get off the
ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.”
She turned on her heel and hurried away.
“Evans!” James shouted after her, “Hey, EVANS!”
But she didn’t look back.
“What is it with her?” said James, trying and failing to look as
though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him.
“Reading between the lines, I’d say she thinks you’re a bit conceited,
mate,” said Sirius.
“Right,” said James, who looked furious now, “right —”
There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside down in the air.
“Who wants to see me take off Snivelly’s pants?”
But whether James really did take off Snape’s pants, Harry never
found out. A hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a
pincerlike grip. Wincing, Harry looked around to see who had hold of
him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape
standing right beside him, white with rage.
“Having fun?”
Harry felt himself rising into the air. The summer’s day evaporated
around him, he was floating upward through icy blackness, Snape’s
hand still tight upon his upper arm. Then, with a swooping feeling as
though he had turned head over heels in midair, his feet hit the stone
floor of Snape’s dungeon, and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape’s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s
study.
“So,” said Snape, gripping Harry’s arm so tightly Harry’s hand was
starting to feel numb. “So . . . been enjoying yourself, Potter?”
“N-no . . .” said Harry, trying to free his arm.
It was scary: Snape’s lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth
were bared.
“Amusing man, your father, wasn’t he?” said Snape, shaking Harry
so hard that his glasses slipped down his nose.
“I — didn’t —”
Snape threw Harry from him with all his might. Harry fell hard
onto the dungeon floor.
“You will not tell anybody what you saw!” Snape bellowed.
“No,” said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could.
“No, of course I w —”
“Get out, get out, I don’t want to see you in this office ever again!”
And as Harry hurtled toward the door, a jar of dead cockroaches
exploded over his head. He wrenched the door open and flew away up
the corridor, stopping only when he had put three floors between
himself and Snape. There he leaned against the wall, panting, and
rubbing his bruised arm.
He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor
to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen. What was making
Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him — it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape
had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he
had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him.

CAREER ADVIC E

But why haven’t you got Occlumency lessons anymore?” said Hermione, frowning.
“I’ve told you,” Harry muttered. “Snape reckons I can carry on by
myself now I’ve got the basics. . . .”
“So you’ve stopped having funny dreams?” said Hermione skeptically.
“Pretty much,” said Harry, not looking at her.
“Well, I don’t think Snape should stop until you’re absolutely sure
you can control them!” said Hermione indignantly. “Harry, I think
you should go back to him and ask —”
“No,” said Harry forcefully. “Just drop it, Hermione, okay?”
It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her
custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedules
for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it — it was easier
than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.
Ron had been startled to discover that there were only six weeks left
until their exams.
“How can that come as a shock?” Hermione demanded, as she
tapped each little square on Ron’s schedule with her wand so that it
flashed a different color according to its subject.
“I dunno . . .” said Ron, “there’s been a lot going on. . . .”
“Well, there you are,” she said, handing him his schedule, “if you
follow that you should do fine.”
Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.
“You’ve given me an evening off every week!”
“That’s for Quidditch practice,” said Hermione.
The smile faded from Ron’s face.
“What’s the point?” he said. “We’ve got about as much chance of
winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad’s got of becoming Minister of Magic. . . .”
Hermione said nothing. She was looking at Harry, who was staring
blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks
pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.
“What’s wrong, Harry?”
“What?” he said quickly. “Nothing . . .”
He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be
looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad
job and slunk away under Hermione’s chair.
“I saw Cho earlier,” said Hermione tentatively, “and she looked really miserable too. . . . Have you two had a row again?”
“Wha — oh yeah, we have,” said Harry, seizing gratefully on the
excuse.
“What about?”
“That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,” said Harry.
“Yeah, well, I don’t blame you!” said Ron angrily, setting down his
study schedule. “If it hadn’t been for her . . .”
Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry
found helpful. All he had to do was look angry, nod, and say “yeah”
 and “that’s right” whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to
dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.
He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside.
He had been so sure that his parents had been wonderful people that
he never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving Snape’s aspersions
on his father’s character. Hadn’t people like Hagrid and Sirius told
Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what
Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry’s head. . . .
He was as bad, wasn’t he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor
McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the
Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside down for the fun of it . . . not unless they really loathed them . . . Perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really
deserved it . . .
Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had
suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to
you?” And hadn’t James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if you
know what I mean?” Hadn’t James started it all simply because Sirius
said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that
he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius. . . .
But in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen. . . .
Harry reminded himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had
been decent, yet the memory of the look on her face as she had
shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else. She
had clearly loathed James and Harry simply could not understand
how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it. . . .
For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of
comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like
James he had glowed with pride inside. And now . . . now he felt cold
and miserable at the thought of him.
The weather grew breezier, brighter, and warmer as the holidays
passed, but Harry was stuck with the rest of the fifth and seventh
years, who were all trapped inside, traipsing back and forth to the library. Harry pretended that his bad mood had no other cause but the
approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his excuse went unchallenged.
“Harry, I’m talking to you, can you hear me?”
“Huh?”
He looked around. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had
joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was
late on Sunday evening; Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor
Tower to review Ancient Runes; Ron had Quidditch practice.
“Oh hi,” said Harry, pulling his books back toward him. “How
come you’re not at practice?”
“It’s over,” said Ginny. “Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.”
“Why?”
“Well, we’re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his
own bat.” She sighed heavily. “Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it’s
only just got through Umbridge’s new screening process. . . .”
She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had
clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a
scribbled note across it in red ink, reading inspected and passed by
the hogwarts high inquisitor.
“It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said Ginny. “There’s one for you. . . .
There you go. . . .”
She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small,
iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of
Fizzing Whizbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a hard lump rise in his throat.
“Are you okay, Harry?” asked Ginny quietly.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was
painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made
him feel like this.
“You seem really down lately,” Ginny persisted. “You know, I’m
sure if you just talked to Cho . . .”
“It’s not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely.
“Who is it, then?” asked Ginny.
“I . . .”
He glanced around to make quite sure that nobody was listening;
Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books
for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.
“I wish I could talk to Sirius,” he muttered. “But I know I can’t.”
More to give himself something to do than because he really
wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit,
and put it into his mouth.
“Well,” said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg too, “if
you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to
do it. . . .”
“Come on,” said Harry hopelessly. “With Umbridge policing the
fires and reading all our mail?”
“The thing about growing up with Fred and George,” said Ginny
thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if
you’ve got enough nerve.”
Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate —
Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors — or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had
been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful. . . .
“WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?”
“Oh damn,” whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. “I forgot —”
Madam Pince was swooping down upon them, her shriveled face
contorted with rage.
“Chocolate in the library!” she screamed. “Out — out — OUT!”
And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry’s books, bag, and
ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them
repeatedly over the head as they ran.
As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets, and notices concerning various
Wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly
before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the
board, which read:

All fifth years will be required to attend a short meeting
with their Head of House during the first week of the Summer term, in which they will be given the opportunity to
discuss their future careers. Times of individual appointments are listed below.
Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall’s office at half-past two on Monday, which would
mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth years spent
a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all
the career information that had been left there for their perusal.
“Well, I don’t fancy Healing,” said Ron on the last evening of the
holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed boneand-wand emblem of St. Mungo’s on its front. “It says here you need
at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration,
Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey. . . .
Don’t want much, do they?”
“Well, it’s a very responsible job, isn’t it?” said Hermione absently.
She was poring over a bright pink-and-orange leaflet that was headed
so you think you’d like to work in muggle relations? “You don’t
seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles. . . . All they
want is an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies. . . . ‘Much more important is your
enthusiasm, patience, and a good sense of fun!’ ”
“You’d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,”
said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like . . .” He
was halfway through a pamphlet on Wizard banking. “Listen to this:
“ ‘Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure, and
substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position
with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting CurseBreakers for thrilling opportunities abroad. . . .’ They want Arithmancy,
though. . . . You could do it, Hermione!”
“I don’t much fancy banking,” said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in have you got what it takes to train security trolls?
“Hey,” said a voice in Harry’s ear. He looked around; Fred and
George had come to join them. “Ginny’s had a word with us about
you,” said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them
and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to
slide off onto the floor. “She says you need to talk to Sirius?”
“What?” said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway
toward picking up make a bang at the department of magical
accidents and catastrophes.
“Yeah . . .” said Harry, trying to sound casual, “yeah, I thought I’d
like —”
“Don’t be so ridiculous,” said Hermione, straightening up and
looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. “With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?”
“Well, we think we can find a way around that,” said George,
stretching and smiling. “It’s a simple matter of causing a diversion.
Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the
mayhem front during the Easter holidays?”
“What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure
time?” continued Fred. “No point at all, we answered ourselves. And
of course, we’d have messed up people’s studying too, which would be
the very last thing we’d want to do.”
He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather
taken aback by this thoughtfulness.
“But it’s business as usual from tomorrow,” Fred continued briskly.
“And if we’re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that
Harry can have his chat with Sirius?”
“Yes, but still,” said Hermione with an air of explaining something
very simple to somebody very obtuse, “even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?”
“Umbridge’s office,” said Harry quietly.
He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no
alternative; Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was
not being watched was her own.
“Are — you — insane?” said Hermione in a hushed voice.
Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade
and was watching the conversation warily.
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging.
“And how are you going to get in there in the first place?”
Harry was ready for this question.
“Sirius’s knife,” he said.
“Excuse me?”
“Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that’ll open any lock,”
said Harry. “So even if she’s bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t
work, which I bet she has —”
“What do you think about this?” Hermione demanded of Ron, and
Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place.
“I dunno,” said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an
opinion. “If Harry wants to do it, it’s up to him, isn’t it?”
“Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,” said Fred, clapping Ron
hard on the back. “Right, then. We’re thinking of doing it tomorrow,
just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact if everybody’s in the corridors — Harry, we’ll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office — I reckon we
should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?” he said,
looking at George.
“Easy,” said George.
“What sort of diversion is it?” asked Ron.
“You’ll see, little bro,” said Fred, as he and George got up again.
“At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor
round about five o’clock tomorrow.”
Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he
had done on the morning of his hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It
was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge’s office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous,
though that was certainly bad enough — today also happened to be
the first time he would be in close proximity with Snape since Snape
had thrown him out of his office, as they had Potions that day.
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry
got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville’s
bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear,
misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the
towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented
Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that
would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know of
any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his
father’s behavior. . . .
Something caught Harry’s attention: movement on the edge of the
Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid
emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry
watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared
inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not
emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could
not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire. . . .
Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk, and
started to dress.
With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge’s office ahead,
Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not
reckoned on Hermione’s almost continual attempts to dissuade him
from what he was planning to do at five o’clock. For the first time ever,
she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic
as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.
“. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she’ll
be able to guess you’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect
she’ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions. . . .”
“Hermione,” said Ron in a low and indignant voice, “are you going
to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to
take notes instead?”
“You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!”
By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was
speaking to Hermione any longer. Undeterred, she took advantage of
their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all
uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to
waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.
Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry
were invisible. Harry was, of course, well used to this tactic, as it was
one of Uncle Vernon’s favorites, and on the whole was grateful he had
to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to
endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found
the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to
find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration
Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the
potion into a flask, corked it, and took it up to Snape’s desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an E.
He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; Malfoy
gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around again. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching him
with a look of gloating pleasure.
“Whoops,” he said softly. “Another zero, then, Potter . . .”
Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron,
intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to
his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.
“I’m sorry!” said Hermione with her hands over her mouth. “I’m
really sorry, Harry, I thought you’d finished, so I cleared up!”
Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang he
hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure
that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so
that Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridge’s
office again.
He was in such a bad mood by the time that he got to Divination
that he had quite forgotten his career appointment with Professor
McGonagall, remembering only when Ron asked him why he wasn’t
in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only
a few minutes late.
“Sorry, Professor,” he panted, as he closed the door. “I forgot. . . .”
“No matter, Potter,” she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody
else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked around.
Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a
fussy little pie-frill around her neck, and a small, horribly smug smile
on her face.
“Sit down, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands
shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.
Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.
“Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might
have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into
sixth and seventh years,” said Professor McGonagall. “Have you had
any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave
Hogwarts?”
“Er,” said Harry.
He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting.
“Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.
“Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,” Harry mumbled.
“You’d need top grades for that,” said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and
opening it. “They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing
under ‘Exceeds Expectations’ grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at
the Auror office. It’s a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the
best. In fact, I don’t think anybody has been taken on in the last three
years.”
At this moment Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as
though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor
McGonagall ignored her.
“You’ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?”
she went on, talking a little more loudly than before.
“Yes,” said Harry. “Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?”
“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “I would also
advise —”
Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this
time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened
them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.
“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently
need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell
you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T.

 663 
classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations’ or higher at
Ordinary Wizarding Level. I’d say you’re averaging ‘Acceptable’ at the
moment, so you’ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms,
always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,” she added, with the
merest flicker of a smile. “Poisons and antidotes are essential study for
Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to
take students who get anything other than ‘Outstanding’ in their
O.W.L.s, so —”
Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.
“May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?” Professor McGonagall
asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.
“Oh no, thank you very much,” said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. “I just wondered whether I could
make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?”
“I daresay you’ll find you can,” said Professor McGonagall through
tightly gritted teeth.
“I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?” said Professor Umbridge sweetly.
“Were you?” said Professor McGonagall haughtily. “Well, Potter,”
she continued, as though there had been no interruption, “if you are
serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on
bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between Acceptable’ and ‘Exceeds Expectations’ for the last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory;
as for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally
high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you — are you quite sure
you wouldn’t like a cough drop, Dolores?”
“Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,” simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. “I was just concerned
that you might not have Harry’s most recent Defense Against the
Dark Arts marks in front of you. I’m quite sure I slipped in a note . . .”
“What, this thing?” said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves
of Harry’s folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised,
then placed it back into the folder without comment.
“Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a
pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror —”
“Did you not understand my note, Minerva?” asked Professor Umbridge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.
“Of course I understood it,” said Professor McGonagall, her teeth
clenched so tightly that the words came out a little muffled.
“Well, then, I am confused. . . . I’m afraid I don’t quite understand
how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that —”
“False hope?” repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look
round at Professor Umbridge. “He has achieved high marks in all his
Defense Against the Dark Arts tests —”
“I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you
will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in
his classes with me —”
“I should have made my meaning plainer,” said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. “He has
achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by
a competent teacher.”
Professor Umbridge’s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb
blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard,
and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from
side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin
nostrils flared, her eyes burning.
“Any questions, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “What sort of character and aptitude tests do the
Ministry do on you, if you get enough N.E.W.T.s?”
“Well, you’ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pres-
sure and so forth,” said Professor McGonagall, “perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical defense. It will mean a lot more study
even after you’ve left school, so unless you’re prepared to —”
“I think you’ll also find,” said Umbridge, her voice very cold now,
“that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurora. Their criminal records.”
“— unless you’re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another —”
“— which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an
Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.”
“A very good chance, then,” said Professor McGonagall.
“Potter has a criminal record,” said Umbridge loudly.
“Potter has been cleared of all charges,” said Professor McGonagall,
even more loudly.
Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not
make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanor
had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look
oddly sinister.
“Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!”
Professor McGonagall got to her feet too, and in her case this was a
much more impressive move. She towered over Professor Umbridge.
“Potter,” she said in ringing tones, “I will assist you to become an
Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly I will
make sure you achieve the required results!”
“The Minister of Magic will never employ Harry Potter!” said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.
“There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is
ready to join!” shouted Professor McGonagall.
“Aha!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby finger at
McGonagall. “Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That’s what you want, isn’t
it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you’ll be where I am, don’t you, Senior
Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot!”
“You are raving,” said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful.
“Potter, that concludes our career consultation.”
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the
room, not daring to look at Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back
along the corridor.
Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run
a race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson
that afternoon.
“I hope you’ve thought better of what you were planning to do,
Harry,” Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their
books to chapter thirty-four (“Non-Retaliation and Negotiation”).
“Umbridge looks like she’s in a really bad mood already. . . .”
Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who
kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking. . . .
He could just imagine Professor McGonagall’s reaction if he were
caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge’s office mere hours after she
had vouched for him. . . . There was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the
next summer holiday he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the
scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve. . . . Nothing, except that
the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as
though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach. . . . And then
there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already
planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was
currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father’s old Invisibility Cloak. . . .
But the fact remained that if he were caught . . .
“Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!”
whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from Umbridge. “And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for
nothing!”
He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer’s day more than twenty
years ago. . . .
And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room. . . .”You’re less like your father than I thought.
. . . The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James. . . .”
But did he want to be like his father anymore?
“Harry, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” Hermione said in anguished
tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.
He did not answer; he did not know what to do. Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice. He would not
look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, “Give it a rest, okay?
He can make up his own mind.”
Harry’s heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway
along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of
a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells
reverberating from somewhere above them. People exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up
at the ceiling fearfully —
Then Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her
short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the
opposite direction: It was now or never.
“Harry — please!” said Hermione weakly.
But he had made up his mind — hitching his bag more securely
onto his shoulder he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students
now hurrying in the opposite direction, off to see what all the fuss was
about in the east wing. . . .
Harry reached the corridor where Umbridge’s office was situated
and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose
helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized
Sirius’s knife, and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly
and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the
corridor until he reached Umbridge’s door.
He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it
and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny
click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed
the door quickly behind him, and looked around.
It was empty; nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on
the plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated
broomsticks.
Harry pulled off his cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found
what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.
He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking.
He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it
must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch
of powder and dropped it onto the logs stacked neatly beneath him.
They exploded at once into emerald-green flames.
“Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” Harry said loudly and clearly.
It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced;
he had traveled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been
his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through
the network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country:
This time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge’s
office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire. . . .
And then, abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling
rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler
around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up
out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat
poring over a piece of parchment.
“Sirius?”
The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin.
“Harry!” he said, looking thoroughly shocked. “What are you —
what’s happened, is everything all right?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I just wondered — I mean, I just fancied a —
a chat with Sirius.”
“I’ll call him,” said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed.
“He went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again. . . .”
And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left
with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why
Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak
out of the fire — his knees were already objecting painfully to their
prolonged contact with Umbridge’s hard stone floor.
Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.
“What is it?” said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out
of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he
and Harry were on a level; Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned. “Are you all right? Do you need help?”
“No,” said Harry, “it’s nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to talk
. . . about my dad. . . .”
They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have
time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer
by the second, and he guessed that five minutes had already passed
from the start of the diversion — George had only guaranteed him
twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he
had seen in the Pensieve.
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
 670 
When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, “I wouldn’t like you to judge your
father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen —”
“I’m fifteen!” said Harry heatedly.
“Look, Harry,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and Snape hated each
other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of
those things, you can understand that, can’t you? I think James was
everything Snape wanted to be — he was popular, he was good at
Quidditch, good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this
little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James —
whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry — always hated
the Dark Arts.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just attacked Snape for no good reason,
just because — well, just because you said you were bored,” he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.
“I’m not proud of it,” said Sirius quickly.
Lupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said, “Look, Harry, what
you’ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in
the school at whatever they did — everyone thought they were the
height of cool — if they sometimes got a bit carried away —”
“If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,” said Sirius.
Lupin smiled.
“He kept messing up his hair,” said Harry in a pained voice.
Sirius and Lupin laughed.
“I’d forgotten he used to do that,” said Sirius affectionately.
“Was he playing with the Snitch?” said Lupin eagerly.
“Yeah,” said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and
Lupin beamed reminiscently. “Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an
idiot.”
“Of course he was a bit of an idiot!” said Sirius bracingly. “We were
all idiots! Well — not Moony so much,” he said fairly, looking at
Lupin, but Lupin shook his head.
“Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the
guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”
“Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves
sometimes. . . . That was something. . . .”
“And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was
on his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the
lake, hoping they were watching him!”
“Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was
around,” said Sirius, shrugging. “He couldn’t stop himself showing off
whenever he got near her.”
“How come she married him?” Harry asked miserably. “She hated
him!”
“Nah, she didn’t,” said Sirius.
“She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.
“Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.
“And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.
“Even Snape?” said Harry.
“Well,” said Lupin slowly, “Snape was a special case. I mean, he
never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn’t really expect
James to take that lying down, could you?”
“And my mum was okay with that?”
“She didn’t know too much about it, to tell you the truth,” said Sirius. “I mean, James didn’t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him
in front of her, did he?”
Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.
“Look,” he said, “your father was the best friend I ever had, and he
was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He
grew out of it.”
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry heavily. “I just never thought I’d feel sorry
for Snape.”
“Now you mention it,” said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, “how did Snape react when he found you’d seen all this?”
“He told me he’d never teach me Occlumency again,” said Harry
indifferently, “like that’s a big disappoint —”
“He WHAT?” shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a
mouthful of ashes.
“Are you serious, Harry?” said Lupin quickly. “He’s stopped giving
you lessons?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great overreaction. “But it’s okay, I don’t care, it’s a bit of a relief to tell you the —”
“I’m coming up there to have a word with Snape!” said Sirius forcefully and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back
down again.
“If anyone’s going to tell Snape it will be me!” he said firmly. “But
Harry, first of all, you’re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears —”
“I can’t tell him that, he’d kill me!” said Harry, outraged. “You
didn’t see him when we got out of the Pensieve —”
“Harry, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!” said Lupin sternly. “Do you understand me? Nothing!”
“Okay, okay,” said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention
annoyed. “I’ll . . . I’ll try and say something to him. . . . But it won’t
be . . .”
He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps.
“Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?”
“No,” said Sirius, glancing behind him. “It must be somebody your
end . . .”
Harry’s heart skipped several beats.
“I’d better go!” he said hastily and he pulled his head backward out
of Grimmauld Place’s fire. For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, and then he found himself kneeling in front
of Umbridge’s fire with his head firmly back on, watching the emerald
flames flicker and die.
“Quickly, quickly!” he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside
the office door. “Ah, she’s left it open. . . .”
Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull
it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge’s
desk, and began rifling through the papers inside it.
“Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it
at last. . . . They’ve had it coming to them for years. . . .”
He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly
back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.
Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure that he had his bag and the
Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open
the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling
along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.
One landing down from Umbridge’s office and Harry thought it
was safe to become visible again; he pulled off the cloak, shoved it in
his bag and hurried onward. There was a great deal of shouting and
movement coming from the entrance hall. He ran down the marble
staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled
there.
It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them,
Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap);
teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was
bobbing overhead, gazed down upon Fred and George, who stood in
the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who
had just been cornered.
“So!” said Umbridge triumphantly, whom Harry realized was
standing just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down
upon her prey. “So . . . you think it amusing to turn a school corridor
into a swamp, do you?”
“Pretty amusing, yeah,” said Fred, looking back up at her without
the slightest sign of fear.
Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with
happiness.
“I’ve got the form, Headmistress,” he said hoarsely, waving the
piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. “I’ve
got the form and I’ve got the whips waiting. . . . Oh, let me do it
now. . . .”
“Very good, Argus,” she said. “You two,” she went on, gazing down
at Fred and George, “are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers
in my school.”
“You know what?” said Fred. “I don’t think we are.”
He turned to his twin.
“George,” said Fred, “I think we’ve outgrown full-time education.”
“Yeah, I’ve been feeling that way myself,” said George lightly.
“Time to test our talents in the real world, d’you reckon?” asked
Fred.
“Definitely,” said George.
And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands
and said together, “Accio Brooms!”
Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to
his left he ducked just in time — Fred and George’s broomsticks,
one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge
had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor toward their owners. They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and
stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on
the flagged stone floor.
“We won’t be seeing you,” Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging
his leg over his broomstick.
“Yeah, don’t bother to keep in touch,” said George, mounting his
own.
Fred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent,
watchful crowd.
“If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley — Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes,” he said in a loud voice. “Our new premises!”
“Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they’re going to
use our products to get rid of this old bat,” added George, pointing at
Professor Umbridge.
“STOP THEM!” shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor,
shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously
below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his
level above the crowd.
“Give her hell from us, Peeves.”
And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute
as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the
students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious
sunset.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y

GRAWP

The story of Fred and George’s flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon
become the stuff of Hogwarts legend. Within a week, even those who
had been eyewitnesses were half-convinced that they had seen the
twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms, pelting her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath
of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them,
so that Harry frequently heard students saying things like, “Honestly,
some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this
place,” or else, “One more lesson like that and I might just do a
Weasley. . . .”
Fred and George had made sure that nobody was likely to forget
them very soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how
to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of
the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different
means of removing it but without success. Eventually the area was
roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of
punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that
teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp
in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire
Whiz-Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.
Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge’s
office door, through which Fred and George’s Cleansweeps had
smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed
Harry’s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, Umbridge
had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were
far from over.
Inspired by Fred and George’s example, a great number of students
were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-inChief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairysnouted niffler into Umbridge’s office, which promptly tore the place
apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge on her reentrance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs
and Stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms
on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of
fresh clean air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of
wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.
Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands,
desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were
now so many of them that he did not know which way to turn. The
Inquisitorial Squad were attempting to help him, but odd things kept
happening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch
team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that
made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes. Pansy
Parkinson, to Hermione’s delight, missed all her lessons the following
day, as she had sprouted antlers.
Meanwhile it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred
and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge
only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to
faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both
nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the
mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering “Umbridge-itis.” After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was
forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating, and
vomiting students to leave her classes in droves.
But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that
master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred’s parting
words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he soared through the school,
upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, and toppling statues
and vases. Twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside suits of armor, from which
she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. He smashed
lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the
heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment
to topple into fires or out of windows, flooded the second floor when
he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he
fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge
and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.
None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help
her. Indeed, a week after Fred and George’s departure Harry witnessed
Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard
her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews
the other way.”
To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn
in the toilet. He remained confused and disorientated and his parents
were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive,
looking extremely angry.
“Should we say something?” said Hermione in a worried voice,
pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see
Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. “About what happened to
him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?”
“ ’Course not, he’ll recover,” said Ron indifferently.
“Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn’t it?” said Harry in a satisfied voice.
He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be
charming with their wands. Harry’s spouted four very short legs that
would not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. Ron’s
grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with
great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the
cup to crack into two.
“Reparo!” said Hermione quickly, mending Ron’s cup with a wave
of her wand. “That’s all very well, but what if Montague’s permanently injured?”
“Who cares?” said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood drunkenly
again, trembling violently at the knees. “Montague shouldn’t have
tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want
to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!”
“You?” she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away
across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs and replacing it in front of her. “Why should I be worried about you?”
“When Mum’s next letter finally gets through Umbridge’s screening process,” said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail
legs tried feebly to support its weight, “I’m going to be in deep trouble. I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s sent a Howler again.”
“But —”
“It’ll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,” said Ron darkly.
“She’ll say I should’ve stopped them leaving, I should’ve grabbed the
ends of their brooms and hung on or something. . . . Yeah, it’ll be all
my fault. . . .”
“Well, if she does say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done
anything! But I’m sure she won’t, I mean, if it’s really true they’ve got
premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for
ages. . . .”
“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said
Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed
again and it lay twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll
need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley,
she’ll want to know what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that
sort of gold. . . .”
“Well, yes, that occurred to me too,” said Hermione, allowing her
teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry’s, whose stubby little
legs were still unable to touch the desktop. “I’ve been wondering
whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or
something awful. . . .”
“He hasn’t,” said Harry curtly.
“How do you know?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“Because —” Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally
seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping
silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals. “Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard
winnings last June.”
There was a shocked silence, then Hermione’s teacup jogged right
over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor.
“Oh, Harry, you didn’t!” she said.
“Yes, I did,” said Harry mutinously. “And I don’t regret it either —
I didn’t need the gold, and they’ll be great at a joke shop. . . .”
“But this is excellent!” said Ron, looking thrilled. “It’s all your fault,
Harry — Mum can’t blame me at all! Can I tell her?”
“Yeah, I suppose you’d better,” said Harry dully. “ ’Specially if she
thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something. . . .”
Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry
had a shrewd suspicion that her self-restraint was bound to crack be-
fore long. Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break and
were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with
a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air.
Harry interrupted her before she had even started.
“It’s no good nagging me, it’s done,” he said firmly. “Fred and
George have got the gold — spent a good bit of it too, by the sounds
of it — and I can’t get it back from them and I don’t want to. So save
your breath, Hermione.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about Fred and George!” she said in
an injured voice.
Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty
look.
“No, I wasn’t!” she said angrily. “As a matter of fact, I was going to
ask Harry when he’s going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlumency lessons again!”
Harry’s heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred
and George’s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many
hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As
Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to
Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell
them. He had ended up saying to them truthfully that Sirius wanted
Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this
ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it.
“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams,” Hermione
said now, “because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your
sleep again. . . .”
Harry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look
ashamed of himself.
“You were only muttering a bit,” he mumbled apologetically.
“Something about ‘just a bit farther.’ ”
“I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,” Harry lied
brutally. “I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the
Quaffle.”
Ron’s ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure: He had
not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.
Last night he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor. He had passed through the circular room,
then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were
ranged dusty glass spheres. . . .
He had hurried straight toward row number ninety-seven, turned
left, and ran along it. . . . It had probably been then that he had spoken aloud. . . . Just a bit farther . . . for he could feel his conscious self
struggling to wake . . . and before he had reached the end of the row,
he had found himself lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of
his four-poster.
“You are trying to block your mind, aren’t you?” said Hermione, looking beadily at Harry. “You are keeping going with your Occlumency?”
“Of course I am,” said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye. The truth was that
he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full
of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue.
The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to studying, his mind seemed
saturated with information when he went to bed so that he found it
very difficult to get to sleep at all. When he did, his overwrought brain
presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. He
also suspected that part of his mind — the part that often spoke in
Hermione’s voice — now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down
that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before
he could reach journey’s end.
“You know,” said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Montague 
doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in
with a chance of winning the Cup.”
“Yeah, I s’pose so,” said Harry, glad of a change of subject.
“I mean, we’ve won one, lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff
next Saturday —”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to: Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at him.
The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although
Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last
match, Gryffindor was not daring to hope for victory, due mainly
(though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron’s abysmal goalkeeping record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism.
“I mean, I can’t get any worse, can I?” he told Harry and Hermione
grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. “Nothing to lose
now, is there?”
“You know,” said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the
pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, “I think Ron
might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly
gave him a lot of confidence. . . .”
Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head.
“Oh gosh, I forgot!” said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its
wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing
Slytherins. “Cho will be playing, won’t she?”
Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.
They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine,
clear day. Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself
hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for
more rousing choruses of “Weasley Is Our King.”
CHAPTER THIRTY
 684 
Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George
had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out onto
the pitches he named the players with something less than his usual
gusto.
“. . . Bradley . . . Davies . . . Chang,” he said, and Harry felt his
stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho
walked out onto the pitch, her shiny black hair rippling in the slight
breeze. He was not sure what he wanted to happen anymore, except
that he could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of her chatting
animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms
caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy.
“And they’re off!” said Lee. “And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, he dodges Johnson, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet as well. . . . He’s going straight
for goal! He’s going to shoot — and — and —” Lee swore very
loudly. “And he’s scored.”
Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Predictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began
to sing:
Weasley cannot save a thing,
He cannot block a single ring . . .
“Harry,” said a hoarse voice in Harry’s ear. “Hermione . . .”
Harry looked around and saw Hagrid’s enormous bearded face
sticking between the seats; apparently he had squeezed his way all
along the row behind, for the first and second years he had just passed
had a ruffled, flattened look about them. For some reason, Hagrid was
bent double as though anxious not to be seen, though he was still at
least four feet taller than everybody else.
“Listen,” he whispered, “can yeh come with me? Now? While ev’ryone’s watchin’ the match?”
“Er . . . can’t it wait, Hagrid?” asked Harry. “Till the match is
over?
“No,” said Hagrid. “No, Harry, it’s gotta be now . . . while ev’ryone’s lookin’ the other way. . . . Please?”
Hagrid’s nose was gently dripping blood. His eyes were both blackened. Harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the
school; he looked utterly woebegone.
“ ’Course,” said Harry at once, “ ’course we’ll come. . . .”
He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing
much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them.
The people in Hagrid’s row were not complaining, merely attempting
to make themselves as small as possible.
“I ’ppreciate this, you two, I really do,” said Hagrid as they reached
the stairs. He kept looking around nervously as they descended toward the lawn below. “I jus’ hope she doesn’ notice us goin’. . . .”
“You mean Umbridge?” said Harry. “She won’t, she’s got her whole
Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn’t you see? She must be expecting trouble at the match.”
“Yeah, well, a bit o’ trouble wouldn’ hurt,” said Hagrid, pausing to
peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted. “Give us more time . . .”
“What is it, Hagrid?” said Hermione, looking up at him with a
concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest.
“Yeh — yeh’ll see in a mo’,” said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder
as a great roar rose from the stands behind them. “Hey — did someone jus’ score?”
“It’ll be Ravenclaw,” said Harry heavily.
“Good . . . good . . .” said Hagrid distractedly. “Tha’s good. . . .”
They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn,
looking around with every other step. When they reached his cabin,
Hermione turned automatically left toward the front door; Hagrid,
however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was
leaning against a tree. When he realized they were no longer with him,
he turned.
“We’re goin’ in here,” he said, jerking his shaggy head behind him.
“Into the forest?” said Hermione, perplexed.
“Yeah,” said Hagrid. “C’mon now, quick, before we’re spotted!”
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the
cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from
them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm. Harry and
Hermione ran to catch up with him.
“Hagrid, why are you armed?” said Harry.
“Jus’ a precaution,” said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders.
“You didn’t bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals,” said Hermione timidly.
“Nah, well, we weren’ goin’ in so far then,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, tha’ was before Firenze left the forest, wasn’ it?”
“Why does Firenze leaving make a difference?” asked Hermione
curiously.
“ ’Cause the other centaurs are good an’ riled at me, tha’s why,” said
Hagrid quietly, glancing around. “They used ter be — well, yeh
couldn’ call ’em friendly — but we got on all righ’. Kept ’emselves to
’emselves, bu’ always turned up if I wanted a word. Not anymore . . .”
He sighed deeply.
“Firenze said that they’re angry because he went to work for Dumbledore?” Harry asked, tripping on a protruding root because he was
busy watching Hagrid’s profile.
“Yeah,” said Hagrid heavily. “Well, angry doesn’ cover it. Ruddy
livid. If I hadn’ stepped in, I reckon they’d’ve kicked Firenze ter
death —”
“They attacked him?” said Hermione, sounding shocked.
“Yep,” said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several lowhanging branches. “He had half the herd onto him —”
“And you stopped it?” said Harry, amazed and impressed. “By
yourself?”
“ ’Course I did, couldn’t stand by an’ watch ’em kill him, could I?”
said Hagrid. “Lucky I was passin’, really . . . an’ I’d’ve thought Firenze
mighta remembered tha’ before he started sendin’ me stupid warnin’s!”
he added hotly and unexpectedly.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid,
scowling, did not elaborate.
“Anyway,” he said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, “since
then the other centaurs’ve bin livid with me an’ the trouble is, they’ve
got a lot of influence in the forest. . . . Cleverest creatures in here . . .”
“Is that why we’re here, Hagrid?” asked Hermione. “The centaurs?”
“Ah no,” said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, “no, it’s not
them. . . . Well, o’ course, they could complicate the problem, yeah.
. . . But yeh’ll see what I mean in a bit. . . .”
On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little
ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great
trouble keeping up with him.
The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew
so closely together as they walked farther and farther into the forest
that it was as dark as dusk. They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the thestrals, but Harry felt no
sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and
began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of
the forest.
“Hagrid?” said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted
brambles over which Hagrid had stepped easily and remembering
very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasions he had
stepped off the forest path. “Where are we going?”
“Bit further,” said Hagrid over his shoulder. “C’mon, Harry. . . .
We need ter keep together now. . . .”
It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches
and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as
though they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione’s
robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for
minutes at a time to free themselves. Harry’s arms and legs were soon
covered in small cuts and scratches. They were so deep in the forest
now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a
massive dark shape ahead of him. Any sound seemed threatening in the
muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest
rustle of movement, though it might have been made by an innocent
sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It
occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature — their absence struck him
as rather ominous.
“Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands?” said Hermione
quietly.
“Er . . . all righ’,” Hagrid whispered back. “In fact . . .”
He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right
into him and was knocked over backward. Harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor.
“Maybe we bes’ jus’ stop fer a momen’, so I can . . . fill yeh in,” said
Hagrid. “Before we ge’ there, like.”
“Good!” said Hermione, as Harry set her back on her feet. They
both murmured “Lumos!” and their wand tips ignited. Hagrid’s face
swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and
Harry saw that he looked nervous and sad again.
“Righ,” said Hagrid. “Well . . . see . . . the thing is . . .”
He took a great breath.
“Well, there’s a good chance I’m goin’ ter be gettin’ the sack any day
now,” he said.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him.
“But you’ve lasted this long —” Hermione said tentatively. “What
makes you think —”
“Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha’ niffler in her office.”
“And was it?” said Harry, before he could stop himself.
“No, it ruddy well wasn’!” said Hagrid indignantly. “On’y anythin’
ter do with magical creatures an’ she thinks it’s got somethin’ ter do
with me. Yeh know she’s bin lookin’ fer a chance ter get rid of me ever
since I got back. I don’ wan’ ter go, o’ course, but if it wasn’ fer . . .
well . . . the special circumstances I’m abou’ ter explain to yeh, I’d
leave righ now, before she’s go’ the chance ter do it in front o’ the
whole school, like she did with Trelawney.”
Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid
overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands.
“It’s not the end o’ the world, I’ll be able ter help Dumbledore once
I’m outta here, I can be useful ter the Order. An’ you lot’ll have
Grubbly-Plank, yeh’ll — yeh’ll get through yer exams fine. . . .” His
voice trembled and broke.
“Don’ worry abou’ me,” he said hastily, as Hermione made to pat
his arm. He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the
pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it. “Look, I wouldn’
be tellin’ yer this at all if I didn’ have ter. See, if I go . . . well, I can’
leave withou’ . . . withou’ tellin’ someone . . . because I’ll — I’ll need
you two ter help me. An’ Ron, if he’s willin’.”
“Of course we’ll help you,” said Harry at once. “What do you want
us to do?”
Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force that Harry was knocked sideways into a tree.
“I knew yeh’d say yes,” said Hagrid into his handkerchief, “but I
won’ . . . never . . . forget . . . Well . . . c’mon . . . jus’ a little bit further through here . . . Watch yerselves, now, there’s nettles. . . .”
They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes. Harry had
opened his mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop.
“Really easy,” he said softly. “Very quiet, now . . .”
They crept forward and Harry saw that they were facing a large,
smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with
a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal. Trees
had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood
on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs
that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which Harry,
Hermione, and Hagrid now stood.
“Sleepin’,” breathed Hagrid.
Sure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that
sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work. He glanced sideways
at Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly
open. She looked utterly terrified.
“Hagrid,” she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the
sleeping creature, “who is he?”
Harry found this an odd question. . . . “What is it?” was the one he
had been planning on asking.
“Hagrid, you told us,” said Hermione, her wand now shaking in
her hand, “you told us none of them wanted to come!”
Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realization hit him,
he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror.
The great mound of earth, on which he, Hermione, and Hagrid
could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with
the deep, grunting breathing. It was not a mound at all. It was the
curved back of what was clearly . . .
“Well — no — he didn’ want ter come,” said Hagrid, sounding
desperate. “But I had ter bring him, Hermione, I had ter!”
“But why?” asked Hermione, who sounded as though she wanted
to cry. “Why — what — oh, Hagrid!”
“I knew if I jus’ got him back,” said Hagrid, sounding close to tears
himself, “an’ — an’ taught him a few manners — I’d be able ter take
him outside an’ show ev’ryone he’s harmless!”
“Harmless!” said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them
grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep. “He’s been hurting you all this
time, hasn’t he? That’s why you’ve had all these injuries!”
“He don’ know his own strength!” said Hagrid earnestly. “An’ he’s
gettin’ better, he’s not fightin’ so much anymore —”
“So this is why it took you two months to get home!” said
Hermione distractedly. “Oh Hagrid, why did you bring him back if
he didn’t want to come, wouldn’t he have been happier with his own
people?”
“They were all bullyin’ him, Hermione, ’cause he’s so small!” said
Hagrid.
“Small?” said Hermione. “Small?”
“Hermione, I couldn’ leave him,” said Hagrid, tears now trickling
down his bruised face into his beard. “See — he’s my brother!”
Hermione simply stared at him, her mouth open.
“Hagrid, when you say ‘brother,’ ” said Harry slowly, “do you
mean — ?”
“Well — half-brother,” amended Hagrid. “Turns out me mother
took up with another giant when she left me dad, an’ she went an’ had
Grawp here —”
“Grawp?” said Harry.
“Yeah . . . well, tha’s what it sounds like when he says his name,”
said Hagrid anxiously. “He don’ speak a lot of English. . . . I’ve bin
tryin’ ter teach him. . . . Anyway, she don’ seem ter have liked him
much more’n she liked me. . . . See, with giantesses, what counts is
producin’ good big kids, and he’s always been a bit on the runty side
fer a giant — on’y sixteen foot —”
“Oh yes, tiny!” said Hermione, with a kind of hysterical sarcasm.
“Absolutely minuscule!”
“He was bein’ kicked around by all o’ them — I jus’ couldn’ leave
him —”
“Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back?” asked Harry.
“She — well, she could see it was right importan’ ter me,” said Hagrid, twisting his enormous hands. “Bu’ — bu’ she got a bit tired of
him after a while, I must admit . . . so we split up on the journey
home. . . . She promised not ter tell anyone though. . . .”
“How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing?”
said Harry.
“Well, tha’s why it took so long, see,” said Hagrid. “Could on’y
travel by nigh an’ through wild country an’ stuff. ’Course, he covers
the ground pretty well when he wants ter, but he kep’ wantin’ ter go
back. . . .”
“Oh Hagrid, why on earth didn’t you let him!” said Hermione,
flopping down onto a ripped-up tree and burying her face in her
hands. “What do you think you’re going to do with a violent giant
who doesn’t even want to be here!”
“Well, now — ‘violent’ — tha’s a bit harsh,” said Hagrid, still
twisting his hands agitatedly. “I’ll admit he mighta taken a couple o’
swings at me when he’s bin in a bad mood, but he’s gettin’ better, loads
better, settlin’ down well. . . .”
“What are those ropes for, then?” Harry asked.
He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around
the trunks of the largest nearby trees toward the place where Grawp
lay curled on the ground with his back to them.
“You have to keep him tied up?” said Hermione faintly.
“Well . . . yeah . . .” said Hagrid, looking anxious. “See — it’s like I
say — he doesn’ really know his strength —”
Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack
of any other living creature in this part of the forest.
“So what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?” Hermione
asked apprehensively.
“Look after him,” said Hagrid croakily. “After I’m gone.”
Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do
whatever he asked.
“What — what does that involve, exactly?” Hermione inquired.
“Not food or anythin’!” said Hagrid eagerly. “He can get his own
food, no problem. Birds an’ deer an’ stuff . . . No, it’s company he
needs. If I jus’ knew someone was carryin’ on tryin’ ter help him a bit
. . . teachin’ him, yeh know . . .”
Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form
lying asleep on the ground in front of them. Grawp had his back to
them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like a very oversize human, Grawp looked strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to
be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he
now recognized as Grawp’s head. It was much larger in proportion to
the body than a human head, almost perfectly round and covered
with tightly curling, close-growing hair the color of bracken. The
rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which
seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon’s, directly upon the shoulders
with little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like
a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad, and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under
the body; Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet,
large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest
floor.
“You want us to teach him,” Harry said in a hollow voice. He now
understood what Firenze’s warning had meant. His attempt is not working. He would do better to abandon it. Of course, the other creatures
who lived in the forest would have heard Hagrid’s fruitless attempts to
teach Grawp English. . . .
“Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit,” said Hagrid hopefully.
CHAPTER THIRTY
 694 
“ ’Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he’ll understand more that
we all like him really, an’ want him to stay. . . .”
Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between
the fingers over her face.
“Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn’t it?” he said
and she gave a very shaky laugh.
“Yeh’ll do it, then?” said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caught
what Harry had just said.
“We’ll . . .” said Harry, already bound by his promise. “We’ll try,
Hagrid. . . .”
“I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,” Hagrid said, beaming in a
very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again.
“An’ I don’ wan’ yeh ter put yerself out too much, like. . . . I know
yeh’ve got exams. . . . If yeh could jus’ nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an’ have a little chat with him . . . I’ll
wake him up, then — introduce you —”
“Wha — no!” said Hermione, jumping up, “Hagrid, no, don’t
wake him, really, we don’t need —”
But Hagrid had already stepped over the great trunk in front of
them and was proceeding toward Grawp. When he was around ten
feet away, he lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, and then poked
Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough.
The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest. Birds in
the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared
away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp
was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself onto his knees and turned his head
to see who and what had disturbed him.
“All righ’, Grawpy?” said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again.
“Had a nice sleep, eh?”
Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he
had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face,
which resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the
clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn onto a great
stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided
and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks. The small
eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half gummed
together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles as big as cricket balls
to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself
to his feet with surprising speed and agility.
“Oh my . . .” Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him.
The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp’s
wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as Hagrid
had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, he reached
out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird’s nest from the
upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a
roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it — eggs fell
like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his
head to protect himself.
“Anyway, Grawpy,” shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in
case of further falling eggs, “I’ve brought some friends ter meet yeh.
Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have
ter go on a little trip an’ leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?”
But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say
whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the
sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of
the pine tree and was pulling it toward him, evidently for the simple
pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go.
“Now, Grawpy, don’ do that!” shouted Hagrid. “Tha’s how you
ended up pullin’ up the others —”
And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree’s roots
beginning to crack.
“I got company fer yeh!” Hagrid shouted. “Company, see! Look
down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!”
“Oh Hagrid, don’t,” moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already
raised the bough again and gave Grawp’s knee a sharp poke.
The giant let go of the top of the pine tree, which swayed menacingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles, and looked down.
“This,” said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione
stood, “is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh’ be comin’ ter visit
yeh if I have ter go away, understand?”
The giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were
there. They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them.
“An’ this is Hermione, see? Her —” Hagrid hesitated. Turning to
Hermione he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione? On’y it’s a difficult name fer him ter remember. . . .”
“No, not at all,” squeaked Hermione.
“This is Hermy, Grawp! An’ she’s gonna be comin’ an’ all! Is’n tha’
nice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter — GRAWPY, NO!”
Grawp’s hand had shot out of nowhere toward Hermione — Harry
seized her and pulled her backward behind the tree, so that Grawp’s
fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air.
“BAD BOY, GRAWPY!” Harry heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione
clung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering. “VERY
BAD BOY! YEH DON’ GRAB — OUCH!”
Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid
lying on his back, his hand over his nose. Grawp, apparently losing interest, had straightened up again and was again engaged in pulling
back the pine as far as it would go.
“Righ’,” said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his
bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow. “Well . . . there
yeh are. . . . Yeh’ve met him an’ — an’ now he’ll know yeh when yeh
come back. Yeah . . . well . . .”
He looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with
an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face; the roots
were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground. . . .
“Well, I reckon tha’s enough fer one day,” said Hagrid. “We’ll —
er — we’ll go back now, shall we?”
Harry and Hermione nodded. Hagrid shouldered his crossbow
again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees.
Nobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the distant
crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last.
Hermione’s face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a single
thing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody
found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the forest? And he had
promised that he, Ron, and Hermione would continue Hagrid’s totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant. . . . How could Hagrid,
even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were lovably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit
to mix with humans?
“Hold it,” said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were
struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him. He pulled
an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the
crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had
stopped walking, they too could hear movement close by.
“Oh blimey,” said Hagrid quietly.
“I thought that we told you, Hagrid,” said a deep male voice, “that
you are no longer welcome here?”
A man’s naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward
them through the dappled green half-light. Then they saw that his
waist joined smoothly with a horse’s chestnut body. This centaur had
a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he
was armed: A quiverful of arrows and a long bow were slung over his
shoulders.
“How are yeh, Magorian?” said Hagrid warily.
The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged
behind him. Harry recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane,
whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met
Firenze. Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before.
“So,” he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning
immediately to Magorian. “We agreed, I think, what we would do if
this human showed his face in the forest again?”
“ ‘This human’ now, am I?” said Hagrid testily. “Jus’ fer stoppin’ all
of yeh committin’ murder?”
“You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,” said Magorian. “Our
ways are not yours, nor are our laws. Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us.”
“I dunno how yeh work that out,” said Hagrid impatiently. “He’s
done nothin’ except help Albus Dumbledore —”
“Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,” said a gray centaur
with a hard, deeply lined face.
“Servitude!” said Hagrid scathingly. “He’s doin’ Dumbledore a favor
is all —”
“He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,” said
Magorian quietly. “There can be no return from such disgrace.”
“If yeh say so,” said Hagrid, shrugging, “but personally I think
yeh’re makin’ a big mistake —”
“As are you, human,” said Bane, “coming back into our forest when
we warned you —”
“Now, you listen ter me,” said Hagrid angrily. “I’ll have less of the
‘our’ forest, if it’s all the same ter you. It’s not up ter you who comes
an’ goes in here —”
“No more is it up to you, Hagrid,” said Magorian smoothly. “I shall
let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young —”
“They’re not his!” interrupted Bane contemptuously. “Students,
Magorian, from up at the school! They have probably already profited
from the traitor Firenze’s teachings. . . .”
“Nevertheless,” said Magorian calmly, “the slaughter of foals is a
terrible crime. . . . We do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you
pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.”
“I won’ be kept outta the fores’ by a bunch of mules like you!” said
Hagrid loudly.
“Hagrid,” said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as
both Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground, “let’s go, please
lets go!
Hagrid moved forward, but his crossbow was still raised and his
eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian.
“We know what you are keeping in the forest, Hagrid!” Magorian
called after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight. “And our tolerance is waning!”
Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk
straight back to Magorian again.
“You’ll tolerate him as long as he’s here, it’s as much his forest as
yours!” he yelled, while Harry and Hermione both pushed with all
their might against Hagrid’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep
him moving forward. Still scowling, he looked down; his expression
changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him. He
seemed not to have felt it.
“Calm down, you two,” he said, turning to walk on while they
panted along behind him. “Ruddy old nags though, eh?”
“Hagrid,” said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles
they had passed on their way there, “if the centaurs don’t want
humans in the forest, it doesn’t really look as though Harry and I will
be able —”
“Ah, you heard what they said,” said Hagrid dismissively “They
wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids. Anyway, we can’ let ourselves be
pushed around by that lot. . . .”
“Nice try,” Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen.
At last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes, the
trees began to thin. They were able to see patches of clear blue sky
again and hear, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and
shouting.
“Was that another goal?” asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of
the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. “Or d’you reckon
the match is over?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she looked
much the worse for wear; her hair was full of bits of twig and leaves,
her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous
scratches on her face and arms. He knew he could look little better.
“I reckon it’s over, yeh know!” said Hagrid, still squinting toward
the stadium. “Look — there’s people comin’ out already — if you two
hurry yeh’ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an’ no one’ll know you
weren’t there!”
“Good idea,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later, then, Hagrid. . . .”
“I don’t believe him,” said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the
moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid. “I don’t believe him. I
really don’t believe him. . . .”
“Calm down,” said Harry.
“Calm down!” she said feverishly. “A giant! A giant in the forest!
And we’re supposed to give him English lessons! Always assuming, of
course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in
and out! I — don’t — believe — him!”
“We haven’t got to do anything yet!” Harry tried to reassure her in
a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading
back toward the castle. “He’s not asking us to do anything unless he
gets chucked out and that might not even happen —”
“Oh come off it, Harry!” said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in
her tracks so that the people behind her had to swerve to avoid her.
“Of course he’s going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest, after what we’ve just seen, who can blame Umbridge?”
There was a pause in which Harry glared at her, and her eyes filled
slowly with tears.
“You didn’t mean that,” said Harry quietly.
“No . . . well . . . all right . . . I didn’t,” she said, wiping her eyes
angrily. “But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself —
for us?”
“I dunno —”
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He didn’t let the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King . . .
“And I wish they’d stop singing that stupid song,” said Hermione
miserably, “haven’t they gloated enough?”
A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the
pitch.
“Oh, let’s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,” said
Hermione.
Weasley can save anything,
He never leaves a single ring
That’s why Gryffindors all sing:
Weasley is our King.
“Hermione . . .” said Harry slowly.
The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd
of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold
moving slowly toward the castle, which was bearing a solitary figure
upon its many shoulders. . . .
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He didn’t let the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King . . .
“No!” said Hermione in a hushed voice.
“YES!” said Harry loudly.
“HARRY! HERMIONE!” yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch
Cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. “WE DID IT! WE
WON!”
They beamed up at him as he passed; there was a scrum at the door
of the castle and Ron’s head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but
nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd
squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight. Harry and
Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of
“Weasley Is Our King” died away. Then they turned to each other,
their smiles fading.
“We’ll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?” said Harry.
“Yes, all right,” said Hermione wearily. “I’m not in any hurry. . . .”
They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure
whether it was his imagination or not, but he rather thought he saw a
small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the treetops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had
just been pulled up by the roots.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - O N E
O.W.L.S

Ron’s euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch Cup
was such that he could not settle to anything next day. All he
wanted to do was talk over the match and Harry and Hermione found
it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp — not
that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to
bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in studying
under the beech tree on the edge of the lake, where they stood less
chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not
particularly keen on this idea at first; he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by Gryffindors walking past his chair, not to
mention the occasional outbursts of “Weasley Is Our King,” but
agreed after a while that some fresh air might do him good.
They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat
down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for
what felt like the dozenth time.
“Well, I mean, I’d already let in that one of Davies’s, so I wasn’t feeling that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came toward me, just
out of nowhere, I thought — you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he
was aiming for the right goal hoop — my right, obviously, his left —
but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the
chance and flew left — his right, I mean — and — well — you saw
what happened,” he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite
unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing
around to see whether the people nearest to them — a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepuffs — had heard him. “And then, when
Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what?” Ron said,
stopping mid-sentence at the look on Harry’s face. “Why are you
grinning?”
“I’m not,” said Harry quickly, looking down at his Transfiguration
notes and attempting to straighten his face. The truth was that Ron
had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch
player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. “I’m
just glad we won, that’s all.”
“Yeah,” said Ron slowly, savoring the words, “we won. Did you see
the look on Chang’s face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from
under her nose?”
“I suppose she cried, did she?” said Harry bitterly.
“Well, yeah — more out of temper than anything, though . . .”
Ron frowned slightly. “But you saw her chuck her broom away when
she got back to the ground, didn’t you?”
“Er —” said Harry.
“Well, actually . . . no, Ron,” said Hermione with a heavy sigh,
putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. “As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies’s first
goal.”
Ron’s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment.
“You didn’t watch?” he said faintly, looking from one to the other.
“You didn’t see me make any of those saves?”
“Well — no,” said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand toward him. “But Ron, we didn’t want to leave — we had to!”
“Yeah?” said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. “How come?”
“It was Hagrid,” said Harry. “He decided to tell us why he’s been
covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted
us to go into the forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he
gets. . . . Anyway . . .”
The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron’s indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity.
“He brought one back and hid it in the forest?”
“Yep,” said Harry grimly.
“No,” said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue.
“No, he can’t have. . . .”
“Well, he has,” said Hermione firmly. “Grawp’s about sixteen feet
tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,” she
snorted, “as Hermy.”
Ron gave a nervous laugh.
“And Hagrid wants us to . . . ?”
“Teach him English, yeah,” said Harry.
“He’s lost his mind,” said Ron in an almost awed voice.
“Yes,” said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate
Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl
turning into a pair of opera glasses. “Yes, I’m starting to think he has.
But unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.”
“Well, you’re just going to have to break your promise, that’s all,”
said Ron firmly. “I mean, come on . . . We’ve got exams and we’re
about that far,” he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger a
millimeter apart, “from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . remember Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better
for mixing with any of Hagrid’s monster mates?”
“I know, it’s just that — we promised,” said Hermione in a small
voice.
Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.
“Well,” he sighed, “Hagrid hasn’t been sacked yet, has he? He’s
hung on this long, maybe he’ll hang on till the end of term and we
won’t have to go near Grawp at all.”
The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly
painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling
lake, the satin-green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze: June
had arrived, but to the fifth years this meant only one thing: Their
O.W.L.s were upon them at last.
Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons
were devoted to reviewing those topics their teachers thought most
likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere
drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from Harry’s mind, though
he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had
ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Occlumency
tuition: If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he
was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite
busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him
about Occlumency. She was spending a lot of time muttering to herself and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.
She was not the only person acting oddly as the O.W.L.s drew
steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of
interrogating people about their study habits.
“How many hours d’you think you’re doing a day?” he demanded
of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam
in his eyes.
“I dunno,” said Ron. “A few . . .”
“More or less than eight?”
“Less, I s’pose,” said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.
“I’m doing eight,” said Ernie, puffing out his chest. “Eight or nine.
I’m getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eight’s my average.
I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday.
Not so good on Tuesday — only seven and a quarter. Then on
Wednesday —”
Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into
greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital.
Meanwhile Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce
panic.
“Of course, it’s not what you know,” he was heard to tell Crabbe
and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to
start, “it’s who you know. Now, Father’s been friendly with the head of
the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda
Marchbanks — we’ve had her round for dinner and everything. . . .”
“Do you think that’s true?” Hermione whispered to Harry and
Ron, looking frightened.
“Nothing we can do about it if it is,” said Ron gloomily.
“I don’t think it’s true,” said Neville quietly from behind them.
“Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran’s, and she’s never
mentioned the Malfoys.”
“What’s she like, Neville?” asked Hermione at once. “Is she strict?”
“Bit like Gran, really,” said Neville in a subdued voice.
“Knowing her won’t hurt your chances though, will it?” Ron told
him encouragingly.
“Oh, I don’t think it will make any difference,” said Neville, still more
miserably. “Gran’s always telling Professor Marchbanks I’m not as good
as my dad. . . . Well . . . you saw what she’s like at St. Mungo’s. . . .”
Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
glanced at one another, but didn’t know what to say. It was the first
time that Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the Wizarding hospital.
Meanwhile a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility, and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth
and seventh years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle
of Baruffio’s Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine
“Outstanding” O.W.L.s he had gained the previous summer and was
offering the whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry
he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts
and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had
confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents
down a toilet.
“Hermione, we wanted to buy that!” shouted Ron.
“Don’t be stupid,” she snarled. “You might as well take Harold
Dingle’s powdered dragon claw and have done with it.”
“Dingle’s got powdered dragon claw?” said Ron eagerly.
“Not anymore,” said Hermione. “I confiscated that too. None of
these things actually works you know —”
“Dragon claw does work!” said Ron. “It’s supposed to be incredible,
really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few
hours — Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can’t hurt —”
“This stuff can,” said Hermione grimly. “I’ve had a look at it, and
it’s actually dried doxy droppings.”
This information took the edge off Harry and Ron’s desire for brain
stimulants.
They received their examination schedules and details of the procedure for O.W.L.s during their next Transfiguration lesson.
“As you can see,” Professor McGonagall told the class while they
copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard,
“your O.W.L.s are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the
theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons.
Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at
night.
“Now, I must warn you that the most stringent Anti-Cheating
Charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer
Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls,
Detachable Cribbing Cuffs, and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am
afraid to say, seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he
or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority’s rules.
I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new — headmistress” — Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the
same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt — “has asked the Heads
of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely — because, of course, your examination results will reflect
upon the headmistress’s new regime at the school. . . .”
Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh. Harry saw the nostrils of
her sharp nose flare.
“However, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your
own futures to think about.”
“Please, Professor,” said Hermione, her hand in the air, “when will
we find out our results?”
“An owl will be sent to you some time in July,” said Professor
McGonagall.
“Excellent,” said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, “so we don’t
have to worry about it till the holidays. . . .”
Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks’
time, waiting for his O.W.L. results. Well, he thought, at least he
would be sure of one bit of post next summer. . . .
Their first exam, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday
morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday but
regretted it almost at once. She was very agitated and kept snatching
the book back from him to check that she had gotten the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge
of Achievements in Charming.
“Why don’t you just do it yourself?” he said firmly, handing the
book back to her, his eyes watering.
Meanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his
fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus was lying flat
on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive
Charm, while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells,
Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic locomotion charms, were making their pencil cases race each other around
the edge of the table.
Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk
much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione on
the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check
some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from
her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.
“Oh, my goodness,” she said faintly, staring into the entrance hall.
“Is that them? Is that the examiners?”
Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the
doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a
small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge,
Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.
“Shall we go and have a closer look?” said Ron.
Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened toward the double
doors into the entrance hall, slowing down as they stepped over the
threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it
looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was
speaking to her very deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be
a little deaf; she was answering Umbridge very loudly considering that
they were only a foot apart.
“Journey was fine, journey was fine, we’ve made it plenty of times
before!” she said impatiently. “Now, I haven’t heard from Dumbledore
lately!” she added, peering around the hall as though hopeful he might
suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. “No idea where he is, I
suppose?”
“None at all,” said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of
the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. “But I daresay the
Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough. . . .”
“I doubt it,” shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, “not if Dumbledore doesn’t want to be found! I should know. . . . Examined him
personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s . . .
Did things with a wand I’d never seen before . . .”
“Yes . . . well . . .” said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron, and
Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they
dared, “let me show you to the staffroom . . . I daresay you’d like a cup
of tea after your journey. . . .”
It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to
do some last-minute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very
far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like
hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall’s furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was
the last thing she did. . . . He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here. . . . He knew that he was
not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory
spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asleep.
None of the fifth years talked very much at breakfast next day either. Parvati was practicing incantations under her breath while the
salt cellar in front of her twitched, Hermione was rereading Achievement in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred, and Neville
kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.
Once breakfast was over, the fifth and seventh years milled around
in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons. Then,
at half-past nine, they were called forward class by class to reenter the
Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as Harry had seen it in
the Pensieve when his father, Sirius, and Snape had been taking their
O.W.L.s. The four House tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the
Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were
all seated and quiet she said, “You may begin,” and turned over an
enormous hourglass on the desk beside her, on which were also spare
quills, ink bottles, and rolls of parchment.
Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard. . . . Three
rows to his right and four seats ahead, Hermione was already scribbling. . . . He lowered his eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation, and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly. . . .
Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and
landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll. . . . Smiling slightly, he
bent over the paper and began to write. . . .
“Well, it wasn’t too bad, was it?” asked Hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. “I’m not
sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of
time — did you put in the countercharm for hiccups? I wasn’t sure
whether I ought to, it felt like too much — and on question twentythree —”
“Hermione,” said Ron sternly, “we’ve been through this before. . . .
We’re not going through every exam afterward, it’s bad enough doing
them once.”
The fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school (the four House
tables reappeared over the lunch hour) and then trooped off into the
small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until
called for their practical examination. As small groups of students
were called forward in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered
incantations and practiced wand movements, occasionally poking one
another in the back or eye by mistake.
Hermione’s name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with
Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry
and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.
“She’ll be fine — remember she got a hundred and twelve percent
on one of our Charms tests?” said Ron.
Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, “Parkinson, Pansy —
Patil, Padma — Patil, Parvati — Potter, Harry.”
“Good luck,” said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall,
clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook.
“Professor Tofty is free, Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, who
was standing just inside the door. He pointed Harry toward what
looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor
Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy.
“Potter, is it?” said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering
over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached. “The famous Potter?”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a
scathing look over at him; the wine glass Malfoy had been levitating
fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a grin. Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly.
“That’s it,” he said in his quavery old voice, “no need to be nervous.
. . . Now, if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some
cartwheels for me. . . .”
On the whole Harry thought it went rather well; his Levitation
Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy’s had been, though he
wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Color-Change and
Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange
swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could
rectify his mistake. He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at
the time and neglected to mention it to her afterward. He could tell
Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large
mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.
There was no time to relax that night — they went straight to the
common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for
Transfiguration next day. Harry went to bed, his head buzzing with
complex spell models and theories.
He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written
exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot
worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas
poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and
somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos,
causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds
were captured and carried out of the Hall.
They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small
bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably
well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for
the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with
any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the
practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from
near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again,
when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very
good indeed! Well, I think that’s all, Potter . . . unless . . .”
He leaned forward a little.
“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?”
Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined
her being sacked.
“Expecto Patronum!”
The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the
length of the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its
progress and when it dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty
clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.
“Excellent!” he said. “Very well, Potter, you may go!”
As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door their eyes met. There
was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did
not care. Unless he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning
on saying it to anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an “Outstanding” O.W.L.
On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat
her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front
of them, they permitted themselves a break from studying. They
stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm
summer air wafted over them as they played a desultory game of wizard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on
the edge of the forest. He was trying to guess what creatures they were
examining — he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys
seemed to be standing back a little — when the portrait hole opened
and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered.
“How were the runes?” said Ron, yawning and stretching.
“I mistranslated ‘ehwaz,’ ” said Hermione furiously. “It means ‘partnership,’ not ‘defense,’ I mixed it up with ‘eihwaz.’ ”
“Ah well,” said Ron lazily, “that’s only one mistake, isn’t it, you’ll
still get —”
“Oh shut up,” said Hermione angrily, “it could be the one mistake
that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. And what’s more,
someone’s put another niffler in Umbridge’s office, I don’t know how
they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and
Umbridge is shrieking her head off — by the sound of it, it tried to
take a chunk out of her leg —”
“Good,” said Harry and Ron together.
“It is not good!” said Hermione hotly. “She thinks it’s Hagrid doing
it, remember? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!”
“He’s teaching at the moment, she can’t blame him,” said Harry,
gesturing out of the window.
“Oh, you’re so naive sometimes, Harry, you really think Umbridge
will wait for proof?” said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in
a towering temper, and she swept off toward the girls’ dormitories,
banging the door behind her.
“Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,” said Ron, very quietly, prodding his queen forward so that she could begin beating up one of
Harry’s knights.
Hermione’s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though
Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of
Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to
which Harry was looking forward least and which he was sure would
be the one that would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an
Auror. Sure enough, he found the written exam difficult, though he
thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice
Potion: He could describe its effects extremely accurately, having
taken it illegally in his second year.
The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to
be. With Snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was
much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions. Neville,
who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had
ever seen him during a Potions class. When Professor Marchbanks
said, “Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,”
Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved
a good grade but that he had, with luck, avoided a fail.
“Only four exams left,” said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed
back to Gryffindor common room.
“Only!” said Hermione snappishly. “I’ve got Arithmancy and it’s
probably the toughest subject there is!”
Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent
her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first
years for giggling too loudly in the common room.
Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday’s Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down. The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the
Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify
the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer
them all milk in turn: knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills
had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw
as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of
a bowtruckle, feed and clean a fire-crab without sustaining serious
burns, and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would
give a sick unicorn.
Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window. When Harry’s examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at
him and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting
thumbs-up before heading back up to the castle.
The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well
enough; Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all of
Jupiter’s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was
inhabited by mice. They had to wait until evening for their practical
Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination.
Even by Harry’s low standards in Divination, the exam went very
badly. He might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely
during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor
Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger,
and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines
on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday.
“Well, we were always going to fail that one,” said Ron gloomily as
they ascended the marble staircase. He had just made Harry feel
rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about
the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look
up and realize he had been describing his examiner’s reflection.
“We shouldn’t have taken the stupid subject in the first place,” said
Harry.
“Still, at least we can give it up now.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “No more pretending we care what happens
when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly . . .”
“And from now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell die, Ron, die —
I’m just chucking them in the bin where they belong.”
Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them.
He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her.
“Well, I think I’ve done all right in Arithmancy,” she said, and
Harry and Ron both sighed with relief. “Just time for a quick look
over our star charts before dinner, then . . .”
When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven
o’clock they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still.
The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight, and there was a slight
chill in the air. Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when
Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank
star chart he or she had been given.
Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them, watching
as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were
observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scribbling of many quills. Half an hour passed, then an hour; the little
squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started
to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished.
As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however,
the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where
he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way
across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment
to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows
moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the
lawn became a sea of darkness once more.
Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there,
but something distracted him. Pausing with his quill suspended over
the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw
half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads,
they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on
which they stood. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling
that he recognized the walk of the squattest among them, who seemed
to be leading the group.
He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside
past midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway
through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus’s position — jamming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was again on the
point of entering it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he
heard a distant knock that echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.
He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrid’s windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were
now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw
six tiny but sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door
closed again and there was silence.
Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or
Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came
walking behind him at that moment, and not wanting to appear as
though he was sneaking looks at anyone else’s work, he hastily bent
over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really
peering over the top of the parapet toward Hagrid’s cabin. Figures were
now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.
He could feel Professor Marchbanks’s eyes on the back of his neck
and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon
though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor
Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that
echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower.
Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their
telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin.
Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.
“Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,” he said softly.
Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left.
Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid’s.
“Ahem — twenty minutes to go,” said Professor Tofty.
Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart; Harry
looked down at his own and noticed that he had mislabelled Venus as
Mars. He bent to correct it.
There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people said
“Ouch!” as they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their
telescopes, hastening to see what was going on below.
Hagrid’s door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the
cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by
the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed
to be attempting to Stun him.
“No!” cried Hermione.
“My dear!” said Professor Tofty in a scandalized voice. “This is an
examination!”
But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star charts
anymore: Jets of red light were still flying beside Hagrid’s cabin, yet
somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him. He was still upright
and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed
across the grounds; a man yelled, “Be reasonable, Hagrid!” and Hagrid
roared, “Reasonable be damned, yeh won’ take me like this, Dawlish!”
Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell
caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury,
lifted the culprit bodily from the ground, and threw him: The man
flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione
gasped, both hands over her mouth; Harry looked around at Ron and
saw that he too was looking scared. None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before. . . .
“Look!” squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and
pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors seemed to have
opened again; more light had spilled out onto the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn.
“Now, really!” said Professor Tofty anxiously. “Only sixteen minutes left, you know!”
But nobody paid him the slightest attention: They were watching
the person now sprinting toward the battle beside Hagrid’s cabin.
“How dare you!” the figure shouted as she ran. “How dare you!”
“It’s McGonagall!” whispered Hermione.
“Leave him alone! Alone, I say!” said Professor McGonagall’s voice
through the darkness. “On what grounds are you attacking him? He
has done nothing, nothing to warrant such —”
Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender all screamed. No fewer than four
Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor
McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her. For a moment she looked luminous, illuminated by an
eerie red glow, then was lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her
back, and moved no more.
“Galloping gargoyles!” shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to
have forgotten the exam completely. “Not so much as a warning! Outrageous behavior!”
“COWARDS!” bellowed Hagrid, his voice carrying clearly to the
top of the tower, and several lights flickered back on inside the castle.
“RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O’ THAT — AN’ THAT —”
“Oh my —” gasped Hermione.
Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by
their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold. Harry saw him
double over and thought for a moment that he had finally been overcome by a spell, but on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back — then Harry
realized that Fang’s limp body was draped around his shoulders.
“Get him, get him!” screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper
seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid’s fists. Indeed,
he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious
colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with
Fang still hung around his neck; Umbridge sent one last Stunning
Spell after him but it missed, and Hagrid, running full-pelt toward the
distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.
There was a long minute’s quivering silence, everybody gazing
openmouthed into the grounds. Then Professor Tofty’s voice said feebly, “Um . . . five minutes to go, everybody . . .”
Though he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was
desperate for the end of the exam. When it came at last he, Ron, and
Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders
and dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were
going to bed — they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot
of the stairs about what they had witnessed.
“That evil woman!” gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having
difficulty talking due to rage. “Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the
dead of night!”
“She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney’s,” said
Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them.
“Hagrid did well, didn’t he?” said Ron, who looked more alarmed
than impressed. “How come all the spells bounced off him?”
“It’ll be his giant blood,” said Hermione shakily. “It’s very hard to
Stun a giant, they’re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor
McGonagall. . . . Four Stunners straight in the chest, and she’s not exactly young, is she?”
“Dreadful, dreadful,” said Ernie, shaking his head pompously.
“Well, I’m off to bed. . . . ’Night, all . . .”
People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about
what they had just seen.
“At least they didn’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,” said Ron.
“I ’spect he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, who looked tearful. “Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now
we’ve lost Hagrid too. . . .”
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full.
The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who
had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, were now telling everyone
what they had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.
“But why sack Hagrid now?” asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her
head. “It’s not like Trelawney, he’s been teaching much better than
usual this year!”
“Umbridge hates part-humans,” said Hermione bitterly, flopping
down into an armchair. “She was always going to try and get Hagrid
out.”
“And she thought Hagrid was putting nifflers in her office,” piped
up Katie Bell.
“Oh blimey,” said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth. “It’s me’s been
putting the nifflers in her office, Fred and George left me a couple,
I’ve been levitating them in through her window. . . .”
“She’d have sacked him anyway,” said Dean. “He was too close to
Dumbledore.”
“That’s true,” said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione’s.
“I just hope Professor McGonagall’s all right,” said Lavender tearfully.
“They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,” said Colin Creevey “She didn’t look very well. . . .”
“Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,” said Alicia Spinnet firmly.
“She’s never failed yet.”
It was nearly four in the morning before the common room
cleared. Harry felt wide awake — the image of Hagrid sprinting away
into the dark was haunting him. He was so angry with Umbridge he
could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron’s
suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts
had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and
arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.
Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that
afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after
breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of lastminute studying, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the
common room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through
some of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that Hermione
had lent him.
The fifth years entered the Great Hall at two o’clock and took their
places in front of their overturned examination papers. Harry felt exhausted. He just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep.
Then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch
pitch — he was going to have a fly on Ron’s broom and savor their
freedom from studying. . . .
“Turn over your papers,” said Professor Marchbanks from the front
of the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass. “You may begin. . . .”
Harry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it; there was
a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows. Slowly,
tortuously, he began to write an answer.
He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates. He simply skipped question four: In your opinion, did
wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of
the eighteenth century? thinking that he would go back to it if he had
time at the end. He had a stab at question five: How was the Statute of
Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a
recurrence? but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points. He had a feeling vampires had come into the story
somewhere. . . .
He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his
eyes alighted upon number ten.
Describe the circumstances that led to the Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join.
I know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack.
He could visualize a heading, in Hermione’s handwriting: The Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards. . . He had read these
notes only this morning. . . .
He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large
hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. He was sitting
right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of
her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden
lights that glistened in it when she moved her head very slightly and
had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.
. . . the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation
of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, but his appointment was contested by
the Wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because —
All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying, burrowing rats. The sun was very hot on the back of his head.
What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein? Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls. . . .
He gazed blankly at the back of Parvati’s head again. If he could only
perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and
see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre
Bonaccord and Liechtenstein. . . .
Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the
glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool. Bonaccord had wanted
to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights . . . but Liechtenstein
was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain
trolls. . . . That was it. . . .
He opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing-white parchment. Slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then
read through what he had done so far. It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione’s notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages. . . .
He closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember.
. . . The confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had
written that already. . . .
Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted. . . . He had written
that too. . . .
And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come . . .
Think, he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him
quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled
through the hourglass at the front. . . .
He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of
Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking
occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last. . . .
The black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the
circular room with its many doors. . . .
Straight across the stone floor and through the second door . . .
patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry. . . .
He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open
just like the others. . . .
Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and
glass spheres. . . . His heart was beating very fast now. . . . He was going to get there this time. . . . When he reached number ninety-seven
he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows. . . .
But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape
moving upon the floor like a wounded animal. . . . Harry’s stomach
contracted with fear . . . with excitement. . . .
A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of
any human kindness, “Take it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I
cannot touch it . . . but you can. . . .”
The black shape upon the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a longfingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm
. . . heard the high, cold voice say, “Crucio!”
The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand
but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the
curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless.
“Lord Voldemort is waiting. . . .”
Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his
shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was bloodstained
and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance. . . .
“You’ll have to kill me,” whispered Sirius.
“Undoubtedly I shall in the end,” said the cold voice. “But you will
fetch it for me first, Black. . . . You think you have felt pain thus far?
Think again. . . . We have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you
scream. . . .”
But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again;
somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk onto the cold stone
floor. Harry hit the ground and awoke, still yelling, his scar on fire, as
the Great Hall erupted all around him.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - T W O
OUT OF THE FIRE

I’m not going. . . . I don’t need the hospital wing. . . . I don’t
want . . .”
He was gibbering, trying to pull away from Professor Tofty, who
was looking at him with much concern, and who had just helped
Harry out into the entrance hall while the students all around them
stared.
“I’m — I’m fine, sir,” Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from his
face. “Really . . . I just fell asleep. . . . Had a nightmare . . .”
“Pressure of examinations!” said the old wizard sympathetically,
patting Harry shakily on the shoulder. “It happens, young man, it
happens! Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready
to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you
may be able to round off your last answer nicely?”
“Yes,” said Harry wildly. “I mean . . . no . . . I’ve done — done as
much as I can, I think. . . .”
“Very well, very well,” said the old wizard gently. “I shall go and
collect your examination paper, and I suggest that you go and have a
nice lie down. . . .”
I
“I’ll do that,” said Harry, nodding vigorously. “Thanks very
much.”
He waited for the second when the old man’s heels disappeared
over the threshold into the Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase and then more staircases toward the hospital wing, hurtling along
the corridors so fast that the portraits he passed muttered reproaches,
and burst through the double doors like a hurricane, causing Madam
Pomfrey, who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montague’s open mouth, to shriek in alarm.
“Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”
“I need to see Professor McGonagall,” gasped Harry, the breath
tearing his lungs. “Now . . . It’s urgent. . . .”
“She’s not here, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey sadly. “She was transferred to St. Mungo’s this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to
the chest at her age? It’s a wonder they didn’t kill her.”
“She’s . . . gone?” said Harry, stunned.
The bell rang just outside the dormitory, and he heard the usual
distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors
above and below him. He remained quite still, looking at Madam
Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside him.
There was nobody left to tell. Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had
gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there,
irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly
present. . . .
“I don’t wonder you’re shocked, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey with
a kind of fierce approval in her face. “As if one of them could have
Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight! Cowardice, that’s
what it was. . . . Despicable cowardice . . . If I wasn’t worried what
would happen to you students without me, I’d resign in protest. . . .”
“Yes,” said Harry blankly.
He strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor
where he stood, buffeted by the crowd, the panic expanding inside
him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think
what to do. . . .
Ron and Hermione, said a voice in his head.
He was running again, pushing students out of the way, oblivious
to their angry protests and shouts. He sprinted back down two floors
and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying
toward him.
“Harry!” said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. “What
happened? Are you all right? Are you ill?”
“Where have you been?” demanded Ron.
“Come with me,” Harry said quickly. “Come on, I’ve got to tell
you something. . . .”
He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived, closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside
and leaning against it, facing them.
“Voldemort’s got Sirius.”
“What?”
“How d’you — ?”
“Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.”
“But — but where? How?” said Hermione, whose face was white.
“I dunno how,” said Harry. “But I know exactly where. There’s a
room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these
little glass balls, and they’re at the end of row ninety-seven . . . He’s
trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there. . . .
He’s torturing him. . . . Says he’ll end by killing him . . .”
Harry found his voice was shaking, as were his knees. He moved
over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself.
“How’re we going to get there?” he asked them.
There was a moment’s silence. Then Ron said, “G-get there?”
“Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!”
Harry said loudly.
“But — Harry . . .” said Ron weakly.
“What? What?” said Harry.
He could not understand why they were both gaping at him as
though he was asking them something unreasonable.
“Harry,” said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, “er . . . how
. . . how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there?”
“How do I know?” bellowed Harry. “The question is how we’re
going to get in there!”
“But . . . Harry, think about this,” said Hermione, taking a step
toward him, “it’s five o’clock in the afternoon. . . . The Ministry of
Magic must be full of workers. . . . How would Voldemort and Sirius
have got in without being seen? Harry . . . they’re probably the two
most wanted wizards in the world. . . . You think they could get into
a building full of Aurors undetected?”
“I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!”
Harry shouted. “Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always
been completely empty whenever I’ve been —”
“You’ve never been there, Harry,” said Hermione quietly. “You’ve
dreamed about the place, that’s all.”
“They’re not normal dreams!” Harry shouted in her face, standing
up and taking a step closer to her in turn. He wanted to shake her.
“How d’you explain Ron’s dad then, what was all that about, how
come I knew what had happened to him?”
“He’s got a point,” said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione.
“But this is just — just so unlikely!” said Hermione desperately.
“Harry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when
he’s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?”
“Sirius might’ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air,” said Ron,
sounding worried. “He’s been desperate to get out of that house for
ages —”
“But why,” Hermione persisted, “why on earth would Voldemort
want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?”
“I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!” Harry yelled at her.
“Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn’t care about seeing
hurt —”
“You know what, I’ve just thought of something,” said Ron in a
hushed voice. “Sirius’s brother was a Death Eater, wasn’t he? Maybe he
told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!”
“Yeah — and that’s why Dumbledore’s been so keen to keep Sirius
locked up all the time!” said Harry.
“Look, I’m sorry,” cried Hermione, “but neither of you are making
sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and
Sirius are even there —”
“Hermione, Harry’s seen them!” said Ron, rounding on her.
“Okay,” she said, looking frightened yet determined, “I’ve just got
to say this. . . .”
“What?”
“You . . . This isn’t a criticism, Harry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I
mean — don’t you think you’ve got a bit of a — a — saving-peoplething?” she said.
He glared at her. “And what’s that supposed to mean, a ‘savingpeople-thing’?”
“Well . . . you . . .” She looked more apprehensive than ever. “I
mean . . . last year, for instance . . . in the lake . . . during the Tournament . . . you shouldn’t have . . . I mean, you didn’t need to save that
little Delacour girl. . . . You got a bit . . . carried away . . .”
A wave of hot, prickly anger swept Harry’s body — how could she
remind him of that blunder now?
“. . . I mean, it was really great of you and everything,” said
Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry’s
face. “Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do —”
“That’s funny,” said Harry in a trembling voice, “because I definitely
remember Ron saying I’d wasted time acting the hero. . . . Is that what
you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?”
“No, no, no!” said Hermione, looking aghast. “That’s not what I
mean at all!”
“Well, spit out what you’ve got to say, because we’re wasting time
here!” Harry shouted.
“I’m trying to say — Voldemort knows you, Harry! He took Ginny
down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it’s the kind of
thing he does, he knows you’re the — the sort of person who’d go to
Sirius’s aid! What if he’s just trying to get you into the Department of
Myst — ?”
“Hermione, it doesn’t matter if he’s done it to get me there or
not — they’ve taken McGonagall to St. Mungo’s, there isn’t anyone
left from the Order at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don’t go,
Sirius is dead!”
“But Harry — what if your dream was — was just that, a dream?”
Harry let out a roar of frustration. Hermione actually stepped back
from him, looking alarmed.
“You don’t get it!” Harry shouted at her. “I’m not having nightmares, I’m not just dreaming! What d’you think all the Occlumency
was for, why d’you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from
seeing these things? Because they’re REAL, Hermione — Sirius is
trapped — I’ve seen him — Voldemort’s got him, and no one else
knows, and that means we’re the only ones who can save him, and if
you don’t want to do it, fine, but I’m going, understand? And if I remember rightly, you didn’t have a problem with my saving-people-thing
when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or” — he rounded
on Ron — “when it was your sister I was saving from the basilisk —”
“I never said I had a problem!” said Ron heatedly.
“But Harry, you’ve just said it,” said Hermione fiercely. “Dumble-
dore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if
you’d done Occlumency properly you’d never have seen this —”
“IF YOU THINK I’M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I
HAVEN’T SEEN —”
“Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind!”
“WELL, I EXPECT HE’D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF
HE KNEW WHAT I’D JUST —”
The classroom door opened. Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped
around. Ginny walked in, looking curious, followed by Luna, who as
usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally.
“Hi,” said Ginny uncertainly. “We recognized Harry’s voice —
what are you yelling about?”
“Never you mind,” said Harry roughly.
Ginny raised her eyebrows.
“There’s no need to take that tone with me,” she said coolly. “I was
only wondering whether I could help.”
“Well, you can’t,” said Harry shortly.
“You’re being rather rude, you know,” said Luna serenely.
Harry swore and turned away. The very last thing he wanted now
was a conversation with Luna Lovegood.
“Wait,” said Hermione suddenly. “Wait . . . Harry, they can help.”
Harry and Ron looked at her.
“Listen,” she said urgently, “Harry, we need to establish whether
Sirius really has left headquarters —”
“I’ve told you, I saw —”
“Harry, I’m begging you, please!” said Hermione desperately.
“Please let’s just check that Sirius isn’t at home before we go charging
off to London — if we find out he’s not there then I swear I won’t try
and stop you, I’ll come, I’ll d-do whatever it takes to try and save
him —” 
“Sirius is being tortured NOW!” shouted Harry. “We haven’t got
time to waste —”
“But if this is a trick of V-Voldemort’s — Harry, we’ve got to check,
we’ve got to —”
“How?” Harry demanded. “How’re we going to check?”
“We’ll have to use Umbridge’s fire and see if we can contact him,”
said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought. “We’ll
draw Umbridge away again, but we’ll need lookouts, and that’s where
we can use Ginny and Luna.”
Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny
said immediately, “Yeah, we’ll do it,” and Luna said, “When you say
‘Sirius,’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman?”
Nobody answered her.
“Okay,” Harry said aggressively to Hermione, “Okay, if you can
think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m going to the Department of Mysteries right now —”
“The Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly surprised. “But how are you going to get there?”
Again, Harry ignored her.
“Right,” said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up
and down between the desks. “Right . . . well . . . One of us has to go
and find Umbridge and — and send her off in the wrong direction,
keep her away from her office. They could tell her — I don’t know —
that Peeves is up to something awful as usual. . . .”
“I’ll do it,” said Ron at once. “I’ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the
Transfiguration department or something, it’s miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if
I met him on the way. . . .”
It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made
no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department.
“Okay,” she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace.
“Now, we need to keep students away from her office while we force
entry, or some Slytherin’s bound to go and tip her off. . . .”
“Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,” said Ginny
promptly, “and warn people not to go down there because someone’s
let off a load of Garroting Gas.” Hermione looked surprised at the
readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie. Ginny shrugged
and said, “Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.”
“Okay,” said Hermione, “well then, Harry, you and I will be under
the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll sneak into the office and you can talk
to Sirius —”
“He’s not there, Hermione!”
“I mean, you can — can check whether Sirius is at home or not
while I keep watch, I don’t think you should be in there alone, Lee’s
already proved the window’s a weak spot, sending those nifflers
through it.”
Even through his anger and impatience Harry recognized Hermione’s offer to accompany him into Umbridge’s office as a sign of
solidarity and loyalty.
“I . . . okay, thanks,” he muttered.
“Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don’t think we’re going to
be able to bank on more than five minutes,” said Hermione, looking
relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, “not with Filch
and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.”
“Five minutes’ll be enough,” said Harry. “C’mon, let’s go —”
“Now?” said Hermione, looking shocked.
“Of course now!” said Harry angrily. “What did you think, we’re
going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now!”
“I — oh all right,” she said desperately. “You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we’ll meet you at the end of Umbridge’s corridor,
okay?”
Harry did not answer, but flung himself out of the room and began
to fight his way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he
met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they
were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room. Harry barely heard them. He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market
butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius’s knife secure in his bag, before they noticed
he had left them.
“Harry, d’you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle
reckons he could sell us some firewhisky. . . .”
But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a
couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron,
Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, who were huddled together at the end
of Umbridge’s corridor.
“Got it,” he panted. “Ready to go, then?”
“All right,” whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years
passed them. “So Ron — you go and head Umbridge off. . . . Ginny,
Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor. . . . Harry
and I will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear. . . .”
Ron strode away, his bright red hair visible right to the end of the
passage. Meanwhile, Ginny’s equally vivid head bobbed between the
jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by
Luna’s blonde one.
“Get over here,” muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry’s wrist and
pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval
wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. “Are — are you sure
you’re okay, Harry? You’re still very pale. . . .”
“I’m fine,” he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out
of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he
thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow. It had hurt much
worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery. . . .
“Here,” he said. He threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them
and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the
bust in front of them.
“You can’t come down here!” Ginny was calling to the crowd. “No,
sorry, you’re going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase,
someone’s let off Garroting Gas just along here —”
They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, “I can’t
see no gas . . .”
“That’s because it’s colorless,” said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, “but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we’ll
have your body as proof for the next idiot who didn’t believe us. . . .”
Slowly the crowd thinned. The news about the Garroting Gas
seemed to have spread — people were not coming this way anymore.
When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, “I think that’s as good as we’re going to get, Harry — come on,
let’s do it.”
Together they moved forward, covered by the cloak. Luna was
standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they
passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, “Good one . . . don’t forget the
signal . . .”
“What’s the signal?” muttered Harry, as they approached Urnbridge’s door.
“A loud chorus of ‘Weasley Is Our King’ if they see Umbridge coming,” replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in
the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open, and they entered the office.
The garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine
warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and empty as
last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief.
“I thought she might have added extra security after the second
niffler. . . .”
They pulled off the cloak. Hermione hurried over to the window
and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand
out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder,
and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into
life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing
fire, and cried, “Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!”
His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground
ride though his knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office
floor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash, and when
the spinning stopped, he opened them to find himself looking out
upon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
There was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst
through his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room.
“Sirius?” he shouted. “Sirius, are you there?”
His voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except
a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire.
“Who’s there?” he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse.
Kreacher the house-elf came creeping into view. He looked highly
delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.
“It’s the Potter boy’s head in the fire,” Kreacher informed the empty
kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry. “What
has he come for, Kreacher wonders?”
“Where’s Sirius, Kreacher?” Harry demanded.
The house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle. “Master has gone out, Harry
Potter.”
“Where’s he gone? Where’s he gone, Kreacher?”
Kreacher merely cackled.
“I’m warning you!” said Harry, fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position.
“What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them, are any of them here?”
“Nobody here but Kreacher!” said the elf gleefully, and turning
away from Harry he began to walk slowly toward the door at the end
of the kitchen. “Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his
Mistress now, yes, he hasn’t had a chance in a long time, Kreacher’s
Master has been keeping him away from her —”
“Where has Sirius gone?” Harry yelled after the elf. “Kreacher, has
he gone to the Department of Mysteries?”
Kreacher stopped in his tracks. Harry could just make out the back
of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him.
“Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,” said the elf
quietly.
“But you know!” shouted Harry. “Don’t you? You know where
he is!”
There was a moment’s silence, then the elf let out his loudest cackle
yet. “Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!”
he said gleefully. “Kreacher and his Mistress are alone again!”
And he scurried forward and disappeared through the door to the
hall.
“You — !”
But before he could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great
pain at the top of his head. He inhaled a lot of ash and, choking,
found himself being dragged backward through the flames until, with
a horrible abruptness, he was staring up into the wide, pallid face of
Professor Umbridge, who had dragged him backward out of the fire
by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as
though she was going to slit his throat.
“You think,” she whispered, bending Harry’s neck back even farther, so that he was looking up at the ceiling above him, “that after
two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature
enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells
placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

boy. Take his wand,” she barked at someone he could not see, and he
felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the
wand. “Hers too . . .”
Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione
had just had her wand wrested from her as well.
“I want to know why you are in my office,” said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered.
“I was — trying to get my Firebolt!” Harry croaked.
“Liar.” She shook his head again. “Your Firebolt is under strict
guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your
head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?”
“No one —” said Harry, trying to pull away from her. He felt several hairs part company with his scalp.
“Liar!” shouted Umbridge. She threw him from her, and he
slammed into the desk. Now he could see Hermione pinioned against
the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill, smirking as he threw Harry’s wand into the air one-handed
and then caught it again.
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins
entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna, and — to Harry’s bewilderment — Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe
and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had
been gagged.
“Got ’em all,” said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forward into
the room. “That one.” he poked a thick finger at Neville, “tried to stop
me taking her,” he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins
of the large Slytherin girl holding her, “so I brought him along too.”
“Good, good,” said Umbridge, watching Ginny’s struggles. “Well,
it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone,
doesn’t it?”
Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave her
wide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered armchair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed.
“So, Potter,” she said. “You stationed lookouts around my office
and you sent this buffoon,” she nodded at Ron, and Malfoy laughed
even louder, “to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the
Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was
busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr.
Filch having just informed me so.
“Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it
Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone. . . .”
Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad
laughed some more at that. Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking.
“It’s none of your business who I talk to,” he snarled.
Umbridge’s slack face seemed to tighten.
“Very well,” she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice.
“Very well, Mr. Potter . . . I offered you the chance to tell me freely.
You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco — fetch
Professor Snape.”
Malfoy stowed Harry’s wand inside his robes and left the room
smirking, but Harry hardly noticed. He had just realized something; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it. He
had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could
help him save Sirius, were gone — but he had been wrong. There
was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts —
Snape.
There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resultant from the Slytherins’ efforts to keep Ron and the others
under control. Ron’s lip was bleeding onto Umbridge’s carpet as he
struggled against Warrington’s half nelson. Ginny was still trying to
stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both her upper arms
in a tight grip. Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face
while tugging at Crabbe’s arms, and Hermione was attempting vainly
to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her. Luna, however, stood limply by
the side of her captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though
rather bored by the proceedings.
Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely.
He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were
heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy came back into the
room, holding open the door for Snape.
“You wanted to see me, Headmistress?” said Snape, looking around
at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete
indifference.
“Ah, Professor Snape,” said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing
up again. “Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as
you can, please.”
“You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,” he said, observing
her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair. “Surely you did
not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient.”
Umbridge flushed.
“You can make some more, can’t you?” she said, her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious.
“Certainly,” said Snape, his lip curling. “It takes a full moon cycle
to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month.”
“A month?” squawked Umbridge, swelling toadishly. “A month?
But I need it this evening, Snape! I have just found Potter using my
fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!”
“Really?” said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he
looked around at Harry. “Well, it doesn’t surprise me. Potter has never
shown much inclination to follow school rules.”
His cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry’s, who met his gaze un-
flinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream,
willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand . . .
“I wish to interrogate him!” shouted Umbridge angrily, and Snape
looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face. “I
wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me
the truth!”
“I have already told you,” said Snape smoothly, “that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Potter — and I
assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did —
I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast
to give the victim much time for truth-telling. . . .”
Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to communicate without words.
Voldemort’s got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he thought desperately. Voldemort’s got Sirius —
“You are on probation!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape
looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. “You are being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most
highly of you! Now get out of my office!”
Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew his
last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking
out of the door.
“He’s got Padfoot!” he shouted. “He’s got Padfoot at the place
where it’s hidden!”
Snape had stopped with his hand on Umbridge’s door handle.
“Padfoot?” cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry
to Snape. “What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he
mean, Snape?”
Snape looked around at Harry. His face was inscrutable. Harry
could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare
speak more plainly in front of Umbridge.
“I have no idea,” said Snape coldly. “Potter, when I want nonsense
shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe,
loosen your hold a little, if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of
tedious paperwork, and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your
reference if ever you apply for a job.”
He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state
of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope. He
looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her
chest was heaving with rage and frustration.
“Very well,” she said, and she pulled out her wand. “Very well . . .
I am left with no alternative. . . . This is more than a matter of school
discipline. . . . This is an issue of Ministry security. . . . Yes . . .
yes . . .”
She seemed to be talking herself into something. She was shifting
her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her
wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily. Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand as he watched her.
“You are forcing me, Potter. . . . I do not want to,” said Umbridge,
still moving restlessly on the spot, “but sometimes circumstances justify the use . . . I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no
choice. . . .”
Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face.
“The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,” said Umbridge quietly.
“No!” shrieked Hermione. “Professor Umbridge — it’s illegal” —
but Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty, eager, excited look
on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand.
“The Minister wouldn’t want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge!” cried Hermione.
“What Cornelius doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” said Umbridge,
who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different

 747 
parts of Harry’s body in turn, apparently trying to decide what would
hurt the most. “He never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last
summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all
the same. . . .”
“It was you?” gasped Harry. “You sent the dementors after me?”
“Somebody had to act,” breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to
rest pointing directly at Harry’s forehead. “They were all bleating
about silencing you somehow — discrediting you — but I was the
one who actually did something about it. . . . Only you wriggled out
of that one, didn’t you, Potter? Not today, though, not now . . .”
And taking a deep breath, she cried, “Cruc —”
“NO!” shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode. “No — Harry — Harry, we’ll have to tell her!”
“No way!” yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione he could
see.
“We’ll have to, Harry, she’ll force it out of you anyway, what’s . . .
what’s the point. . . ?”
And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode’s robes. Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall
immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted.
“Well, well, well!” said Umbridge, looking triumphant. “Little
Miss Question-All is going to give us some answers! Come on then,
girl, come on!”
“Er — my — nee — no!” shouted Ron through his gag.
Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her
before; Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her too. But
Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing
desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear. . . .
“I’m — I’m sorry everyone,” said Hermione. “But — I can’t stand
it —”
“That’s right, that’s right, girl!” said Umbridge, seizing Hermione
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
 748 
by the shoulders, thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and
leaning over her. “Now then . . . with whom was Potter communicating just now?”
“Well,” gulped Hermione into her hands, “well, he was trying to
speak to Professor Dumbledore. . . .”
Ron froze, his eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her
Slytherin captor’s toes; even Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortunately, the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too
exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs.
“Dumbledore?” said Umbridge eagerly. “You know where Dumbledore is, then?”
“Well . . . no!” sobbed Hermione. “We’ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog’s
Head —”
“Idiot girl, Dumbledore won’t be sitting in a pub when the whole
Ministry’s looking for him!” shouted Umbridge, disappointment
etched in every sagging line of her face.
“But — but we needed to tell him something important!” wailed
Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry
knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears.
“Yes?” said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement.
“What was it you wanted to tell him?”
“We . . . we wanted to tell him it’s r-ready!” choked Hermione.
“What’s ready?” demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed
Hermione’s shoulders again and shook her slightly. “What’s ready,
girl?”
“The . . . the weapon,” said Hermione.
“Weapon? Weapon?” said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop
with excitement. “You have been developing some method of resistance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On Professor
Dumbledore’s orders, of course?”

“Y-y-yes,” gasped Hermione. “But he had to leave before it was finished and n-n-now we’ve finished it for him, and we c-c-can’t find him
t-t-to tell him!”
“What kind of weapon is it?” said Umbridge harshly, her stubby
hands still tight on Hermione’s shoulders.
“We don’t r-r-really understand it,” said Hermione, sniffing loudly.
“We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to
do . . .”
Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant.
“Lead me to the weapon,” she said.
“I’m not showing . . . them,” said Hermione shrilly, looking around
at the Slytherins through her fingers.
“It is not for you to set conditions,” said Professor Umbridge
harshly.
“Fine,” said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again, “fine
. . . let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you’d invite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th-that would serve
you right — oh, I’d love it if the wh-whole school knew where it was,
and how to u-use it, and then if you annoy any of them they’ll be able
to s-sort you out!”
These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge. She glanced
swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging
eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the
look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face.
Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment and
then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice. “All
right, dear, let’s make it just you and me . . . and we’ll take Potter too,
shall we? Get up, now —”
“Professor,” said Malfoy eagerly, “Professor Umbridge, I think
some of the squad should come with you to look after —”
“I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think
I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?” asked Umbridge
sharply. “In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is
something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until
I return and make sure none of these” — she gestured around at Ron,
Ginny, Neville, and Luna — “escape.”
“All right,” said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed.
“And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,” said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand. “Lead
on. . . .”

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - T H R E E
FIGHT AND FLIGHT

Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even
whether she had a plan. He walked half a pace behind her as
they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge’s office, knowing it
would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they
were going. He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was
walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged
breathing.
Hermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall. The
din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out
of the double doors to the Great Hall. It seemed incredible to Harry
that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world. . . .
Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the
stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling toward the
tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as Hermione marched
purposefully across the grass, Umbridge jogging to keep up. Their
long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.
H
“It’s hidden in Hagrid’s hut, is it?” said Umbridge eagerly in Harry’s
ear.
“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly. “Hagrid might have set
it off accidentally.”
“Yes,” said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting.
“Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf. . . .”
She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing around and seize her
by the throat, but resisted. His scar was throbbing in the soft evening
air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill. . . .
“Then . . . where is it?” asked Umbridge, with a hint of uncertainty
in her voice as Hermione continued to stride toward the forest.
“In there, of course,” said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees.
“It had to be somewhere that students weren’t going to find it accidentally, didn’t it?”
“Of course,” said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehensive now. “Of course . . . very well, then . . . you two stay ahead of
me.”
“Can we have your wand, then, if we’re going first?” Harry asked
her.
“No, I don’t think so, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge sweetly, poking
him in the back with it. “The Ministry places a rather higher value on
my life than yours, I’m afraid.”
As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch
Hermione’s eye; walking into the forest without wands seemed to him
to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening.
She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and
plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge,
with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up.
“Is it very far in?” Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble.
“Oh yes,” said Hermione. “Yes, it’s well hidden.”
Harry’s misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path
they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he had followed three
years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been
with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger
lay at the end of it.
“Er — are you sure this is the right way?” he asked her pointedly.
“Oh yes,” she said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of
noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither
of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on,
calling loudly over her shoulder, “It’s a bit further in!”
“Hermione, keep your voice down,” Harry muttered, hurrying to
catch up with her. “Anything could be listening in here —”
“I want us heard,” she answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them. “You’ll see. . . .”
They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once
again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all
light. Harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes. . . .
“How much further?” demanded Umbridge angrily from behind
him.
“Not far now!” shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim,
dank clearing. “Just a little bit —”
An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in
the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of
hooves. Harry could feel the forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a
little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield —
He wrenched himself free of her and turned. Around fifty centaurs
were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at
Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge, who backed slowly into the center
of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror.
Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant
smile.
“Who are you?” said a voice.
Harry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian
was walking toward them out of the circle; his bow, like the others’,
was raised. On Harry’s right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her
wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur.
“I asked you who are you, human,” said Magorian roughly.
“I am Dolores Umbridge!” said Umbridge in a high-pitched, terrified voice. “Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!”
“You are from the Ministry of Magic?” said Magorian, as many of
the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly.
“That’s right!” said Umbridge in an even higher voice. “So be very
careful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation
and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as
yourselves on a human —”
“What did you call us?” shouted a wild-looking black centaur,
whom Harry recognized as Bane. There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them.
“Don’t call them that!” Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did
not appear to have heard her. Still pointing her shaking wand at
Magorian, she continued, “Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions —’ ”
“ ‘Near-human intelligence’?” repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground. “We consider that
a great insult, human! Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your
own —”
“What are you doing in our forest?” bellowed the hard-faced gray
centaur whom Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into
the forest. “Why are you here?”
“Your forest?” said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but
also, it seemed, with indignation. “I would remind you that you live
here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of
land —”
An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair
in passing. She let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over
her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter
echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing
hooves was extremely unnerving.
“Whose forest is it now, human?” bellowed Bane.
“Filthy half-breeds!” she screamed, her hands still tight over her
head. “Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!”
“Be quiet!” shouted Hermione, but it was too late — Umbridge
pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, “Incarcerous!”
Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves
tightly around the centaur’s torso and trapping his arms. He gave a cry
of rage and reared onto his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while
the other centaurs charged.
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground. Facedown
on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered
around him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing
and screaming with rage.
“Nooooo!” he heard Umbridge shriek. “Noooooo . . . I am Senior
Undersecretary . . . you cannot . . . unhand me, you animals . . .
nooooo!”
He saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun
one of them — then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few
inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by
Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright.
Her wand fell from her hand to the ground and Harry’s heart leapt, if
he could just reach it —
But as he stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur’s hoof descended
upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half.
“Now!” roared a voice in Harry’s ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright; Hermione too had
been pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-colored backs and
heads of the centaurs Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through
the trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; her voice grew fainter and
fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves
surrounding them.
“And these?” said the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione.
“They are young,” said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry.
“We do not attack foals.”
“They brought her here, Ronan,” replied the centaur who had such
a firm grip on Harry. “And they are not so young. . . . He is nearing
manhood, this one. . . .”
He shook Harry by the neck of his robes.
“Please,” said Hermione breathlessly, “please, don’t attack us, we
don’t think like her, we aren’t Ministry of Magic employees! We only
came in here because we hoped you’d drive her off for us —”
Harry knew at once from the look on the face of the gray centaur
holding Hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this.
The gray centaur threw back his head, his back legs stamping furiously, and bellowed, “You see, Ronan? They already have the arrogance of their kind! So we were to do your dirty work, were we,
human girl? We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies
like obedient hounds?”
“No!” said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. “Please — I didn’t
mean that! I just hoped you’d be able to — to help us —”
But she seemed to be going from bad to worse.
“We do not help humans!” snarled the centaur holding Harry,
tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry’s
feet left the ground momentarily. “We are a race apart and proud to
be so. . . . We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we
did your bidding!”
“We’re not going to say anything like that!” Harry shouted. “We
know you didn’t do anything because we wanted you to —”
But nobody seemed to be listening to him. A bearded centaur toward the back of the crowd shouted, “They came here unasked, they
must pay the consequences!”
A roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur
shouted, “They can join the woman!”
“You said you didn’t hurt the innocent!” shouted Hermione, real
tears sliding down her face now. “We haven’t done anything to hurt
you, we haven’t used wands or threats, we just want to go back to
school, please let us go back —”
“We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!” shouted the
gray centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows.
“Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses? We are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recognize your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are —”
But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment
there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all
of them — Harry, Hermione, and the fifty or so centaurs filling the
clearing — looked around. Harry’s centaur let him fall to the ground
again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows; Hermione
had been dropped too, and Harry hurried toward her as two thick tree
trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant
appeared in the gap.
The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind. The clearing
was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing
upward at the enormous grayish face now looming over them from
just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp’s lopsided mouth
was gaping stupidly. They could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he
squinted down at the creatures at his feet. Broken ropes trailed from
both ankles.
He opened his mouth even wider.
“Hagger.”
Harry did not know what “hagger” meant, or what language it was
from, nor did he much care — he was watching Grawp’s feet, which
were almost as long as Harry’s whole body. Hermione gripped his arm
tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose
huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer
amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped.
“Hagger!” he said again, more insistently.
“Get away from here, giant!” called Magorian. “You are not welcome among us!”
These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp.
He stooped a little (the centaurs’ arms tensed on their bows) and then
bellowed, “HAGGER!”
A few of the centaurs looked worried now. Hermione, however,
gave a gasp.
“Harry!” she whispered. “I think he’s trying to say ‘Hagrid’!”
At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two
humans in a sea of centaurs. He lowered his head another foot or so,
staring intently at them. Harry could feel Hermione shaking as
Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling
voice, “Hermy.”
“Goodness,” said Hermione, gripping Harry’s arm so tightly it was
growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, “he —
he remembered!”
“HERMY!” roared Grawp. “WHERE HAGGER?”
“I don’t know!” squealed Hermione, terrified. “I’m sorry, Grawp, I
don’t know!”
“GRAWP WANT HAGGER!”
One of the giant’s massive hands swooped down upon them —
Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backward and fell over.
Wandless, Harry braced himself to punch, kick, bite, or whatever else
it took as the hand flew toward him and knocked a snow-white centaur off his legs.
It was what the centaurs had been waiting for — Grawp’s outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows went soaring through the air at the giant, peppering his enormous face, causing
him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again, rubbing his
face with his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the heads in still deeper.
He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way. Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp’s blood showered
Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as
fast as they could for the shelter of the trees. Once there they looked
back — Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran all
down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away
through the trees on the other side of the clearing. As Harry and
Hermione watched, Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged after them, smashing more trees aside as he went.
“Oh no,” said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way.
“Oh, that was horrible. And he might kill them all. . . .”
“I’m not that fussed, to be honest,” said Harry bitterly.
The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant
were growing fainter and fainter. As Harry listened to them his scar
gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him.
They had wasted so much time — they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision. Not only
had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.
“Smart plan,” he spat at Hermione, keen to release some of his fury.
“Really smart plan. Where do we go from here?”
“We need to get back up to the castle,” said Hermione faintly.
“By the time we’ve done that, Sirius’ll probably be dead!” said
Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper; there was a high-pitched
chattering overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him.
“Well, we can’t do anything without wands,” said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up again. “Anyway, Harry, how exactly were
you planning to get all the way to London?”
“Yeah, we were just wondering that,” said a familiar voice from behind her.
Harry and Hermione moved instinctively together, peering through
the trees, as Ron came into sight, with Ginny, Neville, and Luna hurrying along behind him. All of them looked a little the worse for
wear — there were several long scratches running the length of
Ginny’s cheek, a large purple lump was swelling above Neville’s right
eye, Ron’s lip was bleeding worse than ever — but all were looking
rather pleased with themselves.
“So,” said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding
out Harry’s wand, “had any ideas?”
“How did you get away?” asked Harry in amazement, taking his
wand from Ron.
“Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,” said Ron airily, now handing back
Hermione’s wand too. “But Ginny was best, she got Malfoy — BatBogey Hex — it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great
flapping things. Anyway, we saw you heading into the forest out of the
window and followed. What’ve you done with Umbridge?”
“She got carried away,” said Harry. “By a herd of centaurs.”
“And they left you behind?” asked Ginny, looking astonished.
“No, they got chased off by Grawp,” said Harry.
“Who’s Grawp?” Luna asked interestedly.
“Hagrid’s little brother,” said Ron promptly. “Anyway, never mind
that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-KnowWho got Sirius or — ?”
“Yes,” said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, “and I’m
sure Sirius is still alive, but I can’t see how we’re going to get there to
help him.”
They all fell silent, looking rather scared. The problem facing them
seemed insurmountable.
“Well, we’ll have to fly, won’t we?” said Luna in the closest thing to
a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard her use.
“Okay,” said Harry irritably, rounding on her, “first of all, ‘we’
aren’t doing anything if you’re including yourself in that, and second
of all, Ron’s the only one with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by
a security troll, so —”
“I’ve got a broom!” said Ginny.
“Yeah, but you’re not coming,” said Ron angrily.
“Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!”
said Ginny, her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George
was suddenly striking.
“You’re too —” Harry began.
“I’m three years older than you were when you fought You-KnowWho over the Sorcerer’s Stone,” she said fiercely, “and it’s because of
me Malfoy’s stuck back in Umbridge’s office with giant flying bogeys
attacking him —”
“Yeah, but —”
“We were all in the D.A. together,” said Neville quietly. “It was all
supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn’t it? And this is
the first chance we’ve had to do something real — or was that all just
a game or something?”
“No — of course it wasn’t —” said Harry impatiently.
“Then we should come too,” said Neville simply. “We want to help.”
“That’s right,” said Luna, smiling happily.
Harry’s eyes met Ron’s. He knew that Ron was thinking exactly
what he was: If he could have chosen any members of the D.A. in addition to himself, Ron, and Hermione to join him in the attempt to
rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville, or Luna.
“Well, it doesn’t matter anyway,” said Harry frustratedly, “because
we still don’t know how to get there —”
“I thought we’d settled that?” said Luna maddeningly. “We’re
flying!”
“Look,” said Ron, barely containing his anger, “you might be able
to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can’t sprout wings whenever we —”
“There are other ways of flying than with broomsticks,” said Luna
serenely.
“I s’pose we’re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or
whatever it is?” Ron demanded.
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can’t fly,” said Luna in a dignified
voice, “but they can, and Hagrid says they’re very good at finding
places their riders are looking for.”
Harry whirled around. Standing between two trees, their white
eyes gleaming eerily, were two thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word.
“Yes!” he whispered, moving toward them. They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out
his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one’s shining neck. How could
he ever have thought them ugly?
“Is it those mad horse things?” said Ron uncertainly, staring at a
point slightly to the left of the thestral Harry was patting. “Those ones
you can’t see unless you’ve watched someone snuff it?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“How many?”
“Just two.”
“Well, we need three,” said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.
“Four, Hermione,” said Ginny, scowling.
“I think there are six of us, actually,” said Luna calmly, counting.
“Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go!” said Harry angrily. “Look, you
three” — he pointed at Neville, Ginny, and Luna — “you’re not involved in this, you’re not —”
They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful,
twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have
time to argue.
“Okay, fine, it’s your choice,” he said curtly. “But unless we can find
more thestrals you’re not going to be able —”
“Oh, more of them will come,” said Ginny confidently, who like
Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the
impression that she was looking at the horses.
“What makes you think that?”
“Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both
covered in blood,” she said coolly, “and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the
first place. . . .”
Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down
to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with
Grawp’s blood.
“Okay, then,” he said, a bright idea occurring. “Ron and I will take
these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three
and she’ll attract more thestrals —”
“I’m not staying behind!” said Hermione furiously.
“There’s no need,” said Luna, smiling. “Look, here come more
now. . . . You two must really smell. . . .”
Harry turned. No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking
their way through the trees now, their great leathery wings folded
tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He
had no excuse now. . . .
“All right,” he said angrily, “pick one and get on, then.”

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - F O U R
THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES

Harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest
thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby, and scrambled
clumsily onto the horse’s silken back. It did not object, but twisted its
head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking
of his robes.
He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing
joints that made him feel more secure and looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and
was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature’s back.
Luna was already in place, sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robes as
though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, however,
were still standing motionless on the spot, openmouthed and staring.
“What?” he said.
“How’re we supposed to get on?” said Ron faintly. “When we can’t
see the things?”
“Oh it’s easy,” said Luna, sliding obligingly from her thestral and
marching over to him, Hermione, and Ginny. “Come here. . . .”
She pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and
one by one managed to help them onto the backs of their mounts. All
three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into the
horses’ manes and told them to grip tightly before getting back onto
her own steed.
“This is mad,” Ron said faintly, moving his free hand gingerly up
and down his horse’s neck. “Mad . . . if I could just see it —”
“You’d better hope it stays invisible,” said Harry darkly. “We all
ready, then?”
They all nodded and he saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath
their robes.
“Okay . . .”
He looked down at the back of his thestral’s glossy black head and
swallowed. “Ministry of Magic, visitors’ entrance, London, then,” he
said uncertainly. “Er . . . if you know . . . where to go . . .”
For a moment his thestral did nothing at all. Then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast
and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly
around the horse to avoid sliding backward over its bony rump. He
closed his eyes and put his face down into the horse’s silky mane as
they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out
into a bloodred sunset.
Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: The thestral
streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating. The cooling air
was slapping Harry’s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind,
he looked around and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him,
each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to
protect themselves from its slipstream.
They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade. Harry could see mountains and gullies below them. In the
falling darkness Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed
over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was
beetling its way home through the hills. . . .
“This is bizarre!” Harry heard Ron yell from somewhere behind
him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this
height with no visible means of support. . . .
Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with
tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that
gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very
fast they were traveling. Harry’s arms were wrapped tightly around his
horse’s neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had
elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries
floor? How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort? All
Harry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort
wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would
cause him to feel Voldemort’s jubilation or fury course through his
own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr.
Weasley was attacked. . . .
On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry’s face felt stiff
and cold, his legs numb from gripping the thestral’s sides so tightly,
but he did not dare shift positions lest he slip. . . . He was deaf from
the thundering in his ears and his mouth was dry and frozen from the
rush of cold night air. He had lost all sense of how far they had come;
all his faith was in the beast below him, still streaking purposefully
through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onward. . . .
If they were too late . . .
He’s still alive, he’s still fighting, I can feel it. . . .
If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack . . .
I’d know. . . .
Harry’s stomach gave a jolt. The thestral’s head was suddenly pointing toward the ground and he had actually slid forward a few inches
along its neck. They were descending at last. . . . He heard one of the
girls shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see
no sign of a falling body. . . . Presumably they had received a shock
from the change of position, just as he had. . . .
And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on
all sides. They could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights
like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows.
Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling toward the pavement.
Harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength,
braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as
lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from his back, looking around at
the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from
the vandalized telephone box, both drained of color in the flat orange
glare of the streetlights.
Ron landed a short way away and toppled immediately off his thestral onto the pavement.
“Never again,” he said, struggling to his feet. He made as though to
stride away from his thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its
hindquarters and almost fell over again. “Never, ever again . . . that
was the worst —”
Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him. Both
slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with
similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground. Neville
jumped down, shaking, but Luna dismounted smoothly.
“Where do we go from here, then?” she asked Harry in a politely
interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip.
“Over here,” he said. He gave his thestral a quick, grateful pat, then
led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the
door. “Come on!” he urged the others as they hesitated.
Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville, and
Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back
at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the
dumpster, then forced himself into the box after Luna.
“Whoever’s nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!” he said.
Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial. As it whirred
back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box, “Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.”
“Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,” Harry said very
quickly, “Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood . . .
We’re here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first!”
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitors, please take the
badges and attach them to the front of your robes.”
Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned
coins usually appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them
mutely to Harry over Ginny’s head; he glanced at the topmost one.
HARRY POTTER
rescue mission
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and
present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.”
“Fine!” Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb. “Now can
we move?”
The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose
up past the glass windows of the telephone box. The scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight, blackness closed over their heads, and
with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic.
A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up
their bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he
could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see
whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed
to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by
day. There were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the
walls, but he saw as the lift slid smoothly to a halt that golden symbols
continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,” said the
woman’s voice.
The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of
it, followed by Neville and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was
the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the
wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur’s arrow, the
tip of the goblin’s hat, and the house-elf’s ears continued to gush into
the surrounding pool.
“Come on,” said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off
down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain, toward the desk
where the security man who had weighed Harry’s wand had sat and
which was now deserted.
Harry felt sure that there ought to be a security person there, sure
that their absence was an ominous sign, and his feeling of foreboding
increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts. He
pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost
immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clanking, and they dashed inside. Harry stabbed the number nine button,
the grilles closed with a bang, and the lift began to descend, jangling
and rattling. Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the
day that he had come with Mr. Weasley — he was sure that the din
would raise every security person within the building, yet when the
lift halted, the cool female voice said, “Department of Mysteries,” and
the grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where
nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of
air from the lift.
Harry turned toward the plain black door. After months and
months of dreaming about it, he was here at last. . . .
“Let’s go,” he whispered, and he led the way down the corridor,
Luna right behind him, gazing around with her mouth slightly open.
“Okay, listen,” said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the
door. “Maybe . . . maybe a couple of people should stay here as a —
as a lookout, and —”
“And how’re we going to let you know something’s coming?” asked
Ginny, her eyebrows raised. “You could be miles away.”
“We’re coming with you, Harry,” said Neville.
“Let’s get on with it,” said Ron firmly.
Harry still did not want to take them all with him, but it seemed he
had no choice. He turned to face the door and walked forward. Just as
it had in his dream, it swung open and he marched forward, leading
the others over the threshold.
They were standing in a large, circular room. Everything in here
was black including the floor and ceiling — identical, unmarked,
handle-less black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls,
interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue, their
cool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor so that it
looked as though there was dark water underfoot.
“Someone shut the door,” Harry muttered.
He regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it.
Without the long chink of light from the torch-lit corridor behind
them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they
could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and
their ghostly reflections in the floor below.
In his dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this
room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on.
But there were around a dozen doors here. Just as he was gazing ahead
at the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one,
there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways. The circular wall was rotating.
Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm as though frightened the floor
might move too, but it did not. For a few seconds the blue flames
around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped
THE DEPARTMENT
OF MYSTERIES
 771 
around and then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling
stopped and everything became stationary once again.
Harry’s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could
see.
“What was that about?” whispered Ron fearfully.
“I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from,”
said Ginny in a hushed voice.
Harry realized at once that she was right: He could no sooner have
picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jetblack floor. Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to proceed could be any of the dozen surrounding them.
“How’re we going to get back out?” said Neville uncomfortably.
“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said Harry forcefully, blinking to
try and erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand
tighter than ever. “We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius —”
“Don’t go calling for him, though!” Hermione said urgently, but
Harry had never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as
quiet as possible for the time being.
“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.
“I don’t —” Harry began. He swallowed. “In the dreams I went
through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark
room — that’s this one — and then I went through another door into
a room that kind of . . . glitters. We should try a few doors,” he said
hastily. “I’ll know the right way when I see it. C’mon.”
He marched straight at the door now facing him, the others following close behind him, set his left hand against its cool, shining surface,
raised his wand, ready to strike the moment it opened, and pushed. It
swung open easily.
After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on
golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering,
shimmering lights such as Harry had seen in his dreams. The place
was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the
room, an enormous glass tank of deep-green water, big enough for all
of them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects
that were drifting around lazily in the liquid.
“What’re those things?” whispered Ron.
“Dunno,” said Harry.
“Are they fish?” breathed Ginny.
“Aquavirius maggots!” said Luna excitedly. “Dad said the Ministry
were breeding —”
“No,” said Hermione. She sounded odd. She moved forward to
look through the side of the tank. “They’re brains.”
“Brains?”
“Yes . . . I wonder what they’re doing with them?”
Harry joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mistake now that he saw them at close quarters. Glimmering eerily they
drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green water, looking
something like slimy cauliflowers.
“Let’s get out of here,” said Harry. “This isn’t right, we need to try
another door —”
“There are doors here too,” said Ron, pointing around the walls.
Harry’s heart sank; how big was this place?
“In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,”
he said. “I think we should go back and try from there.”
So they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly
shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry’s eyes instead
of the blue candle flames.
“Wait!” said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of
the brain room behind them. “Flagrate!”
She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the
door. No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there
was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very
fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue,
and when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing
the door they had already tried.
“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Okay, let’s try this one —”
Again he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open,
his wand still raised, the others at his heels.
This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the
center of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet below them. They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to
be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep
steps like an amphitheater, or the courtroom in which Harry had been
tried by the Wizengamot. Instead of a chained chair, however, there was
a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor, and upon this dais
stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling
that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing. Unsupported by
any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air, was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched.
“Who’s there?” said Harry, jumping down onto the bench below.
There was no answering voice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway.
“Careful!” whispered Hermione.
Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the
stone bottom of the sunken pit. His footsteps echoed loudly as he
walked slowly toward the dais. The pointed archway looked much
taller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down
on it from above. Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had
just passed through it.
“Sirius?” Harry spoke again, but much more quietly now that he
was nearer.
He had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right
behind the veil on the other side of the archway. Gripping his wand
very tightly, he edged around the dais, but there was nobody there. All
that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil.
“Let’s go,” called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps. “This
isn’t right, Harry, come on, let’s go. . . .”
She sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room
where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of
beauty about it, old though it was. The gently rippling veil intrigued
him; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk
through it.
“Harry, let’s go, okay?” said Hermione more forcefully.
“Okay,” he said, but he did not move. He had just heard something. There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from
the other side of the veil.
“What are you saying?” he said very loudly, so that the words
echoed all around the surrounding stone benches.
“Nobody’s talking, Harry!” said Hermione, now moving over to
him.
“Someone’s whispering behind there,” he said, moving out of her
reach and continuing to frown at the veil. “Is that you, Ron?”
“I’m here, mate,” said Ron, appearing around the side of the archway.
“Can’t anyone else hear it?” Harry demanded, for the whispering
and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put
it there, he found his foot was on the dais.
“I can hear them too,” breathed Luna, joining them around the
side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil. “There are people
in there!”
“What do you mean, ‘in there’?” demanded Hermione, jumping
down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted. “There isn’t any ‘in there,’ it’s just an archway, there’s
no room for anybody to be there — Harry, stop it, come away —”
She grabbed his arm and pulled, but he resisted.
“Harry, we are supposed to be here for Sirius!” she said in a highpitched, strained voice.
“Sirius,” Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the continuously swaying veil. “Yeah . . .”
And then something slid back into place in his brain: Sirius, captured, bound, and tortured, and he was staring at this archway. . . .
He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes
from the veil.
“Let’s go,” he said.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to — well, come on, then!” said
Hermione, and she led the way back around the dais. On the other
side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil
too. Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny’s arm, Ron
Neville’s, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone
bench and clambered all the way back up to the door.
“What d’you reckon that arch was?” Harry asked Hermione as they
regained the dark circular room.
“I don’t know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,” she said
firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door.
Once more the wall spun and became still again. Harry approached
a door at random and pushed. It did not move.
“What’s wrong?” said Hermione.
“It’s . . . locked . . .” said Harry, throwing his weight at the door,
but it did not budge.
“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the
attempt to force the door open. “Bound to be!”
“Get out of the way!” said Hermione sharply. She pointed her
wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door
and said, “Alohomora!”
Nothing happened.
“Sirius’s knife!” said Harry, and he pulled it out from inside his
robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall. The
others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom, withdrew
it, and then flung his shoulder again at the door. It remained as firmly
shut as ever. What was more, when Harry looked down at the knife,
he saw that the blade had melted.
“Right, we’re leaving that room,” said Hermione decisively.
“But what if that’s the one?” said Ron, staring at it with a mixture
of apprehension and longing.
“It can’t be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,”
said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius’s knife in his pocket.
“You know what could be in there?” said Luna eagerly, as the wall
started to spin yet again.
“Something blibbering, no doubt,” said Hermione under her
breath, and Neville gave a nervous little laugh.
The wall slid back to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing
desperation, pushed the next door open.
“This is it!”
He knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling
light. As Harry’s eyes became more accustomed to the brilliant glare
he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless
ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering
crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room.
“This way!”
Harry’s heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were
on the right track. He led the way forward down the narrow space between the lines of the desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for
the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that
stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering
wind.
“Oh look !” said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very
heart of the bell jar.
Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewelbright egg. As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird
emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on
the draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the
time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.
“Keep going!” said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of
wanting to stop and watch the egg’s progress back into a bird.
“You dawdled enough by that old arch!” she said crossly, but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it.
“This is it,” Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so
hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech. “It’s through
here —”
He glanced around at them all. They had their wands out and
looked suddenly serious and anxious. He looked back at the door
and pushed. It swung open.
They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and
full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs.
They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets
set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in the circular room behind them, their flames were burning blue. The room was very cold.
Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles
between two rows of shelves. He could not hear anything nor see the
slightest sign of movement.
“You said it was row ninety-seven,” whispered Hermione.
“Yeah,” breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row.
Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure 53.
“We need to go right, I think,” whispered Hermione, squinting to
the next row. “Yes . . . that’s fifty-four. . . .”
“Keep your wands out,” Harry said softly.
They crept forward, staring behind them as they went on down the
long alleys of shelves, the farther ends of which were in near total
darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb
on the shelf. Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as
dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs.
They passed row eighty-four . . . eighty-five . . . Harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement, but Sirius might be
gagged now, or else unconscious . . . or, said an unbidden voice inside
his head, he might already be dead. . . .
I’d have felt it, he told himself, his heart now hammering against his
Adam’s apple. I’d already know. . . .
“Ninety-seven!” whispered Hermione.
They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the
alley beside it. There was nobody there.
“He’s right down at the end,” said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry. “You can’t see properly from here. . . .”
And he led them forward, between the towering rows of glass balls,
some of which glowed softly as they passed. . . .
“He should be near here,” whispered Harry, convinced that every
step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view upon the
darkened floor. “Anywhere here . . . really close . . .”
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to respond. His mouth was very dry now.
“Somewhere about . . . here . . .” he said.
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim
candlelight. There was nobody there at all. All was echoing, dusty
silence.
“He might be . . .” Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the
alley next door. “Or maybe . . .” He hurried to look down the one
beyond that.
“Harry?” said Hermione again.
“What?” he snarled.
“I . . . I don’t think Sirius is here.”
Nobody spoke. Harry did not want to look at any of them. He felt
sick. He did not understand why Sirius was not here. He had to be
here. This was where he, Harry, had seen him. . . .
He ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them.
Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past. He ran the other way,
back past his staring companions. There was no sign of Sirius anywhere, nor any hint of a struggle.
“Harry?” Ron called.
“What?”
He did not want to hear what Ron had to say, did not want to hear
Ron tell him he had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back
to Hogwarts. But the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though
he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others’ accusing stares. . . .
“Have you seen this?” said Ron.
“What?” said Harry, but eagerly this time — it had to be a sign that
Sirius had been there, a clue — he strode back to where they were all
standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves.
“What?” Harry repeated glumly.
“It’s — it’s got your name on,” said Ron.
Harry moved a little closer. Ron was pointing at one of the small
glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very
dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years.
“My name?” said Harry blankly.
He stepped forward. Not as tall as Ron, he had to crane his neck to
read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty
glass ball. In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years
previously, and below that:
S. P. T. to A. P. W. B. D.
Dark Lord
and (?) Harry Potter
Harry stared at it.
“What is it?” Ron asked, sounding unnerved. “What’s your name
doing down here?”
He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf.
“I’m not here,” he said, sounding perplexed. “None of the rest of us
are here. . . .”
“Harry, I don’t think you should touch it,” said Hermione sharply,
as he stretched out his hand.
“Why not?” he said. “It’s something to do with me, isn’t it?”
“Don’t, Harry,” said Neville suddenly. Harry looked around at
him. Neville’s round face was shining slightly with sweat. He looked
as though he could not take much more suspense.
“It’s got my name on,” said Harry.
And feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty
ball’s surface. He had expected it to feel cold, but it did not. On the
contrary, it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours, as
though the glow of light within was warming it. Expecting, even hoping, that something dramatic was going to happen, something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile
after all, he lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it.
Nothing whatsoever happened. The others moved in closer around
Harry, gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust.
And then, from right behind them, a drawling voice said, “Very
good, Potter. Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me.”

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - F I V E
BEYOND THE VEIL

Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a
dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave
a gasp of horror.
“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he
held out his hand, palm up.
Harry’s insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped and
outnumbered two to one.
“To me,” said Malfoy yet again.
“Where’s Sirius?” Harry said.
Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the
midst of the shadowy figures to Harry’s left said triumphantly, “The
Dark Lord always knows!”
“Always,” echoed Malfoy softly. “Now, give me the prophecy,
Potter.”
“I want to know where Sirius is!”
“I want to know where Sirius is!” mimicked the woman to his left.
She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were
mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands
dazzling Harry’s eyes.
“You’ve got him,” said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest,
the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninetyseventh row. “He’s here. I know he is.”
“The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was
twoo,” said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron
stir beside him.
“Don’t do anything,” he muttered. “Not yet —”
The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of
laughter.
“You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!”
“Oh, you don’t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,” said Malfoy softly.
“He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this
about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.”
“I know Sirius is here,” said Harry, though panic was causing his
chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly.
“I know you’ve got him!”
More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed
loudest of all.
“It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,” said Malfoy. “Now give me the prophecy, or we start using
wands.”
“Go on, then,” said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As
he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna
rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened. If
Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no
reason at all. . . .
But the Death Eaters did not strike.
“Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,” said Malfoy
coolly.
It was Harry’s turn to laugh.
“Yeah, right!” he said. “I give you this — prophecy, is it? And you’ll
just let us skip off home, will you?”
The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death
Eater shrieked, “Accio Proph —”
Harry was just ready for her. He shouted “Protego!” before she had
finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his
fingers he managed to cling on to it.
“Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,” she said, her
mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. “Very well, then —”
“I TOLD YOU, NO!” Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. “If you
smash it — !”
Harry’s mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty
spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get
them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity . . .
The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off
her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange’s face, making it
gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow.
“You need more persuasion?” she said, her chest rising and falling
rapidly. “Very well — take the smallest one,” she ordered the Death
Eaters beside her. “Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I’ll
do it.”
Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways
so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest.
“You’ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,” he told
Bellatrix. “I don’t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back
without it, will he?”
She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue
moistening her thin mouth.
“So,” said Harry, “what kind of prophecy are we talking about
anyway?”
He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville’s arm
was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking. He could feel
one of the other’s quickened breath on the back of his head. He was
hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank.
“What kind of prophecy?” repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from
her face. “You jest, Harry Potter.”
“Nope, not jesting,” said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater
to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they
could escape. “How come Voldemort wants it?”
Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses.
“You dare speak his name?” whispered Bellatrix.
“Yeah,” said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. “Yeah, I’ve got no
problem saying Vol —”
“Shut your mouth!” Bellatrix shrieked. “You dare speak his name
with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood’s
tongue, you dare —”
“Did you know he’s a half-blood too?” said Harry recklessly.
Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. “Voldemort? Yeah, his mother
was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot
he’s pureblood?”
“STUPEF —”
“NO!”
A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange’s
wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the
shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there
shattered.
Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began
to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments
of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix’s
shouts.
“. . . at the Solstice will come a new . . .” said the figure of an old,
bearded man.
“DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!”
“He dared — he dares —” shrieked Bellatrix incoherently. “— He
stands there — filthy half-blood —”
“WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PROPHECY!” bawled Malfoy.
“. . . and none will come after . . .” said the figure of a young woman.
The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had
melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile
homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however,
given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the
others.
“You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m supposed to be handing over,” he said, playing for time. He moved his
foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else’s.
“Do not play games with us, Potter,” said Malfoy.
“I’m not playing games,” said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone’s toes
and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him
told him they were Hermione’s.
“What?” she whispered.
“Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was
hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said Malfoy
sneeringly.
“I — what?” said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan.
“What about my scar?”
“What?” whispered Hermione more urgently behind him.
“Can this be?” said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some
of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
 786 
laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, “Smash shelves —”
“Dumbledore never told you?” Malfoy repeated. “Well, this explains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered
why —”
“— when I say go —”
“— you didn’t come running when he showed you the place where
it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would
make you want to hear the exact wording. . . .”
“Did he?” said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard
Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep
talking, to distract the Death Eaters. “So he wanted me to come and
get it, did he? Why?”
“Why?” Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. “Because the
only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as
the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it
for him.”
“And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?”
“About both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven’t you ever
wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?”
Harry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoy’s gray
eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry’s parents had
died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to
all of this clutched in his hand?
“Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?” he said
quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm
glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still
gritty with dust. “And he’s made me come and get it for him? Why
couldn’t he come and get it himself?”
“Get it himself?” shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter.
“The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so
sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear
cousin?”
“So he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?” said Harry.
“Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?”
“Very good, Potter, very good . . .” said Malfoy slowly. “But the
Dark Lord knows you are not unintell —”
“NOW!” yelled Harry.
Five different voices behind him bellowed “REDUCTO!” Five
curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them
exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass
spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and
floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead
past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor —
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and
more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of
Hermione’s robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as
chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A
Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were
cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their
spheres —
Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna
sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck
him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and
sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout “Stupefy!” and the hand released him at once.
They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and
began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him
and Hermione’s voice urging Neville on. The door through which
they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering
light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched
tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the
threshold before slamming the door behind them —
“Colloportus!” gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an
odd squelching noise.
“Where — where are the others?” gasped Harry.
He had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of
them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody
there.
“They must have gone the wrong way!” whispered Hermione, terror in her face.
“Listen!” whispered Neville.
Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just
sealed. Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius
Malfoy roar: “Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care
for Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come
back here, we need to organize! We’ll split into pairs and search, and
don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy, you
can kill the others if necessary — Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the
left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight
ahead — Macnair and Avery, through here — Rookwood, over
there — Mulciber, come with me!”
“What do we do?” Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to
foot.
“Well, we don’t stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,”
said Harry. “Let’s get away from this door. . . .”
They ran, quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where
the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, toward the exit into the
circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there
when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door
Hermione had charmed shut.
“Stand aside!” said a rough voice. “Alohomora!”
As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under
desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters’ robes
drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly.
“They might’ve run straight through to the hall,” said the rough
voice.
“Check under the desks,” said another.
Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out
from under the desk he shouted, “STUPEFY !”
A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into
a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater,
however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry’s spell and now pointed his
own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to
get a better aim.
“Avada —”
Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death
Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry.
Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand
wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “EXPELLIARMUS !”
Both Harry’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of their hands
and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both
scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in
front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly
horrorstruck at what he had done.
“Get out of the way, Harry!” yelled Neville, clearly determined to
repair the damage.
Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and
shouted, “STUPEFY !”
The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and
hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell
down again, and shattered —
The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor
beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk
as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he
ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, “STUP —”
“STUPEFY !” screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with
them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his
chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a
clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected
to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto
the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar
as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest,
sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar
full of glittering wind.
“Accio Wand!” cried Hermione. Harry’s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him.
“Thanks,” he said, “right, let’s get out of —”
“Look out!” said Neville, horrified, staring at the Death Eater’s
head in the bell jar.
All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them
struck. They were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was
happening to the man’s head.
It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair
and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull
round and covered with a peachlike fuzz. . . .
A baby’s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled
neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as
they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previ-
ous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate
and chin. . . .
“It’s time,” said Hermione in an awestruck voice. “Time . . .”
The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but
before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to
babyhood once more. . . .
There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream.
“RON?” Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. “GINNY? LUNA?”
“Harry!” Hermione screamed.
The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby’s head bawling loudly while
his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing
Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement
Hermione seized his arm.
“You can’t hurt a baby!”
There was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and
knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their
position.
“Come on!” he said again, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death
Eater staggering behind them, they took off for the door that stood
ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway.
They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open
door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward
them. Veering left he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office
and slammed the door behind them.
“Collo —” began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell
the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come
hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, “IMPEDIMENTA!”
Harry, Hermione, and Neville were all knocked backward off their
feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view,
Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a
cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry’s head slammed into the
stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a
moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react.
“WE’VE GOT HIM!” yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, “IN
AN OFFICE OFF —”
“Silencio!” cried Hermione, and the man’s voice was extinguished.
He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound
came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow.
“Petrificus Totalus!” shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised
his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward,
facedown onto the rug at Harry’s feet, stiff as a board and unable to
move at all.
“Well done, Ha —”
But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of
what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione’s chest;
she gave a tiny “oh!” as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the
floor where she lay motionless.
“HERMIONE!”
Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward
her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death
Eater kicked out hard at Neville’s head as he emerged — his foot
broke Neville’s wand in two and connected with his face — Neville
gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry
twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death
Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at
Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily
Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the
Prewetts.
Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the
prophecy still clutched in Harry’s hand, to himself, then at Hermione.
Though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been
clearer: Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her. . . .
“Like you won’t kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway!” said
Harry.
A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking
properly. He had one hand on Hermione’s shoulder, which was still
warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don’t let her be dead, don’t
let her be dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead. . . .
“Whaddever you do, Harry,” said Neville fiercely from under the
desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood
pouring down his mouth and chin, “don’d gib it to him!”
Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over
his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the
doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at
everything around him.
Harry seized his chance: “PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!”
The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it, and he toppled forward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to
move an inch.
“Hermione,” Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed
Death Eater blundered out of sight again. “Hermione, wake up. . . .”
“Whaddid he do to her?” said Neville, crawling out from under the
desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly
swelling nose. “I dunno. . . .”
Neville groped for Hermione’s wrist.
“Dat’s a pulse, Harry, I’b sure id is. . . .”
Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed.
“She’s alive?”
“Yeah, I dink so. . . .”
There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of
more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room.
“Neville, we’re not far from the exit,” Harry whispered. “We’re
right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it
and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet
you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you
could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . .”
“And whad are you going do do?” said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry.
“I’ve got to find the others,” said Harry.
“Well, I’b going do find dem wid you,” said Neville firmly.
“But Hermione —”
“We’ll dake her wid us,” said Neville firmly. “I’ll carry her — you’re
bedder at fighding dem dan I ab —”
He stood up and seized one of Hermione’s arms, glared at Harry,
who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione’s
limp form over Neville’s shoulders.
“Wait,” said Harry, snatching up Hermione’s wand from the floor
and shoving it into Nevilles hand, “you’d better take this. . . .”
Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they
walked slowly toward the door.
“My gran’s going do kill be,” said Neville thickly, blood spattering
from his nose as he spoke, “dat was by dad’s old wand. . . .”
Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously.
The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into
things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling
and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had
contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on
the wall behind them.
“He’s never going to notice us,” he whispered. “C’mon . . . keep
close behind me. . . .”
They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the
black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a
few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione’s
weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and
the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of
Harry’s head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes,
swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking
heart Harry saw that Hermione’s fiery crosses had faded from the
doors.
“So which way d’you reck — ?”
But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a
door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it.
“Ron!” croaked Harry, dashing toward them. “Ginny — are you
all — ?”
“Harry,” said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the
front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. “There
you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You’re all messed
up. . . .
Ron’s face was very white and something dark was trickling from
the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but
he still clutched the front of Harry’s robes, so that Harry was pulled
into a kind of bow.
“Ginny?” Harry said fearfully. “What happened?”
But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle.
“I think her ankle’s broken, I heard something crack,” whispered
Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt.
“Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very
odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark —”
“Harry, we saw Uranus up close!” said Ron, still giggling feebly.
“Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus — ha ha ha —”
A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron’s mouth and burst.
“Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny’s foot, I used the Reductor
Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . .”
Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very
shallow way, her eyes still closed.
“And what about Ron?” said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to
giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry’s robes.
“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna sadly, “but he’s
gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all. . . .”
“Harry,” said Ron, pulling Harry’s ear down to his mouth and still
giggling weakly, “you know who this girl is, Harry? She’s Loony . . .
Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . .”
“We’ve got to get out of here,” said Harry firmly. “Luna, can you
help Ginny?”
“Yes,” said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping,
putting an arm around Ginny’s waist and pulling her up.
“It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!” said Ginny impatiently, but
next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron’s arm over his shoulder just as, so many
months ago, he had pulled Dudley’s. He looked around: They had a
one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time —
He heaved Ron toward a door; they were within a few feet of it
when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters
sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange.
“There they are!” she shrieked.
Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way
through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and
ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione. They were all over the
threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix.
“Colloportus!” shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into
the door on the other side.
“It doesn’t matter!” said a man’s voice. “There are other ways in —
WE’VE GOT THEM, THEY’RE HERE!”
Harry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure
enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps
in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join
the first.
“Luna — Neville — help me!”
The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they
went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his
haste to reach the next door.
“Colloportus!”
There were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now
and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it
creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors
along the opposite wall — then, as Harry reached the very top of the
room, he heard Luna cry, “Collo — aaaaaaaaargh . . .”
He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death
Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not
reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the
floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione.
“Get Potter!” shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her
and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought
they might hit the prophecy —
“Hey!” said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. “Hey, Harry, there are brains in
here, ha ha ha, isn’t that weird, Harry?”
“Ron, get out of the way, get down —”
But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank.
“Honest, Harry, they’re brains — look — Accio Brain!”
The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville
and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch
the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared
toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of
moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film —
“Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it —” said Ron, watching it disgorge its
gaudy innards. “Harry, come and touch it, bet it’s weird —”
“RON, NO!”
Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would
not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught
the brain in his outstretched hands.
The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began
wrapping themselves around Ron’s arms like ropes.
“Harry, look what’s happen — no — no, I don’t like it — no,
stop — stop —”
But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron’s chest now. He
tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like
an octopus’s body.
“Diffindo!” yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break.
Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds.
“Harry, it’ll suffocate him!” screamed Ginny, immobilized by her
broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of
the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled
over sideways and lay there unconscious.
“STUBEFY !” shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving
Hermione’s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters. “STUBEFY,
STUBEFY !”
But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own
Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville
were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of
whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters.
in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange
sprinted right at him. Holding the prophecy high above his head he
sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw
the Death Eaters away from the others.
It seemed to have worked. They streaked after him, knocking chairs
and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the
prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one
through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron — find some way of releasing
him — he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor
vanish —
He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath
out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the
stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the
Death Eaters’ laughter. He looked up and saw the five who had been
in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more
emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to
bench toward him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him. The prophecy was still
miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in
his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the
Death Eaters within his sights. The back of his legs hit something
solid; he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed
backward onto it.
The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as
hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full
Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry’s face.
“Potter, your race is run,” drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his
mask. “Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy. . . .”
“Let — let the others go, and I’ll give it to you!” said Harry
desperately.
A few of the Death Eaters laughed.
“You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy,
his pale face flushed with pleasure. “You see, there are ten of us and
only one of you . . . or hasn’t Dumbledore ever taught you how to
count?”
“He’s dot alone!” shouted a voice from above them. “He’s still god
be!”
Harry’s heart sank. Neville was scrambling down the stone benches
toward them, Hermione’s wand held fast in his trembling hand.
“Neville — no — go back to Ron —”
“STUBEFY !” Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each
Death Eater in turn, “STUBEFY ! STUBE —”
One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the
Death Eaters laughed.
“It’s Longbottom, isn’t it?” sneered Lucius Malfoy. “Well, your
grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause. . . . Your
death will not come as a great shock. . . .”
“Longbottom?” repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her
gaunt face. “Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents,
boy. . . .”
“I DOE YOU HAB!” roared Neville, and he fought so hard against
his captor’s encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, “Someone
Stun him!”
“No, no, no,” said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. “No, let’s see
how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents. . . . Unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy —”
“DON’D GIB ID DO DEM!” roared Neville, who seemed beside
himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his
captor, her wand raised. “DON’D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!”
Bellatrix raised her wand. “Crucio!”
Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death
Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The
Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and
screaming in agony.
“That was just a taster!” said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that
Neville’s screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned
and gazed up at Harry. “Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or
watch your little friend die the hard way!”
Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy
was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forward to take it.
Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more
people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and
Kingsley.
Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a
Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had
made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters
were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the
Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped
from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He
dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to
reach Neville.
“Are you okay?” he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their
heads.
“Yes,” said Neville, trying to pull himself up.
“And Ron?”
“I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I
left —”
The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a
crater right where Neville’s hand had been seconds before. Both
scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere,
seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes
were barely touching the floor.
“Give it to me,” growled a voice in his ear, “give me the
prophecy —”
The man was pressing so tightly on Harry’s windpipe that he could
not breathe — through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a
Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once;
Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix — nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. . . . He
turned his wand backward toward the man’s side, but had no breath
to utter an incantation, and the man’s free hand was groping toward
the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy —
“AARGH!”
Neville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a
spell, he had jabbed Hermione’s wand hard into the eyehole of the
Death Eater’s mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of
pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, “STUPEFY !”
The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It
was Macnair, Buckbeak’s would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen
and bloodshot.
“Thanks!” Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his
Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were
blurs. Then Harry’s foot made contact with something round and
hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the
prophecy, then saw Moody’s magic eye spinning away across the floor.
Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his
long pale face twisted with glee.
“Tarantallegra!” he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose
legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing
him and causing him to fall to the floor again. “Now, Potter —”
He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had
used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, “Protego!”
Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the
force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville’s jerking
legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.
Dolohov raised his wand again. “Accio Proph —”
Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder,
and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to
the tips of Harry’s fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords,
sparks flying from their wand tips —
Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement
he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled,
“Petrificus Totalus!” Once again, Dolohov’s arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back.
“Nice one!” shouted Sirius, forcing Harry’s head down as a pair of
Stunning Spells flew toward them. “Now I want you to get out of —”
They both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed
Sirius; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the
stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and
Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray.
“Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!” Sirius yelled,
dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next:
Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew
over Harry’s head as he launched himself toward Neville —
“Can you stand?” he bellowed in Neville’s ear, as Neville’s legs jerked
and twitched uncontrollably. “Put your arm round my neck —”
Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville’s legs were still flying in
every direction, they would not support him and then, out of
nowhere, a man lunged at them. Both fell backward, Neville’s legs
waving wildly like an overturned beetle’s, Harry with his left arm held
up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed.
“The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!” snarled Lucius Malfoy’s voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy’s wand pressing
hard between his ribs.
“No — get — off — me . . . Neville — catch it!”
Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself
around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed
the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over
his shoulder and yelled, “Impedimenta!”
Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he
looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius
and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and
Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had
jumped between them.
“Harry, round up the others and GO!”
Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him
bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville’s legs twitched and
jerked and would not support his weight. Harry heaved again with all
the strength he possessed and they climbed another step —
A spell hit the stone bench at Harry’s heel. It crumbled away and
he fell back to the step below: Neville sank to the ground, his legs still
jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into his pocket.
“Come on!” said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville’s robes. “Just
try and push with your legs —”
He gave another stupendous heave and Neville’s robes tore all along
the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket
and before either of them could catch it, one of Neville’s floundering
feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the
step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had
broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with
hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them.
Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams
and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he
hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness.
“Harry, I’b sorry!” cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, “I’b so sorry, Harry, I didn’d bean do —”
“It doesn’t matter!” Harry shouted. “Just try and stand, let’s get out
of —”
“Dubbledore!” said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported,
staring over Harry’s shoulder.
“What?”
“DUBBLEDORE!”
Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above
them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus
Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a
kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — they
were saved.
Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had
no more thought of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of
the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there. There
were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey
up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore’s spell pulled him back as
easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible
line —
Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new
arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: He was laughing at her. “Come on, you can do better than that!” he yelled, his voice
echoing around the cavernous room.
The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest.
The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened
in shock.
Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was
jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore
turned to the dais too.
It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the
arch. . . .
And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather’s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient
doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place.
Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange’s triumphant scream, but knew it
meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he
would reappear from the other side any second. . . .
But Sirius did not reappear.
“SIRIUS!” Harry yelled, “SIRIUS!”
He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius
must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out
again. . . .
But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin
grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back.
“There’s nothing you can do, Harry —”
“Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through!”
“It’s too late, Harry —”
“We can still reach him —”
Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . .
“There’s nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He’s gone.”
C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - S I X
THE ONLY ONE HE EVER FEARED
He hasn’t gone!” Harry yelled.
He did not believe it, he would not believe it; still he
fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had: Lupin did not understand, people hid behind that curtain, he had heard them whispering
the first time he had entered the room — Sirius was hiding, simply
lurking out of sight —
“SIRIUS!” he bellowed, “SIRIUS!”
“He can’t come back, Harry,” said Lupin, his voice breaking as he
struggled to contain Harry. “He can’t come back, because he’s d —”
“HE — IS — NOT — DEAD!” roared Harry. “SIRIUS!”
There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling,
the flashes of more spells. To Harry it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin stop pretending that Sirius, who was standing feet
from them behind that old curtain, was not going to emerge at any
moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to reenter the battle —
Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais, Harry still staring at the
archway, angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting —
But some part of him realized, even as he fought to break free from
Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before. . . . Sirius had
risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him. . . . If Sirius was
not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him
as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was
that he could not come back. . . . That he really was . . .
Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in
the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes.
Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay and
was attempting to revive her. Behind the dais there were still flashes of
light, grunts, and cries — Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius’s duel with Bellatrix.
“Harry?”
Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place
where Harry stood. Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin,
who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless.
“Harry . . . I’b really sorry. . . .” said Neville. His legs were still
dancing uncontrollably. “Was dat man — was Sirius Black a — a
friend of yours?”
Harry nodded.
“Here,” said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville’s legs
he said, “Finite.” The spell was lifted. Neville’s legs fell back onto the
floor and remained still. Lupin’s face was pale. “Let’s — let’s find the
others. Where are they all, Neville?”
Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. It sounded as
though every word was causing him pain.
“Dey’re all back dere,” said Neville. “A brain addacked Ron bud I
dink he’s all righd — and Herbione’s unconscious, bud we could feel
a bulse —”
There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw
Kingsley, yelling in pain, hit the ground. Bellatrix Lestrange turned
tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her
but she deflected it. She was halfway up the steps now —
“Harry — no!” cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm
from Lupin’s slackened grip.
“SHE KILLED SIRIUS!” bellowed Harry. “SHE KILLED HIM
— I’LL KILL HER!”
And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches. People were
shouting behind him but he did not care. The hem of Bellatrix’s robes
whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the
brains were swimming. . . .
She aimed a curse over her shoulder. The tank rose into the air and
tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within. The
brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long, colored tentacles, but he shouted, “Wingardium Leviosa!” and they flew
into the air away from him. Slipping and sliding he ran on toward the
door. He leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny,
who said, “Harry — what — ?” past Ron, who giggled feebly, and
Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door
into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a
door on the other side of the room — beyond her was the corridor
leading back to the lifts.
He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls
had begun to rotate again. Once more he was surrounded by streaks
of blue light from the whirling candelabra.
“Where’s the exit?” he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a
halt again. “Where’s the way out?”
The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door
right behind him flew open, and the corridor toward the lifts stretched
ahead of him, torch-lit and empty. He ran. . . .
He could hear a lift clattering ahead of him. He sprinted up the
passageway, swung around the corner, and slammed his fist onto the
button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower; the
grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button
marked Atrium. The doors slid shut and he was rising. . . .
He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open
and looked around. Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the
other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted toward her,
and aimed another spell at him. He dodged behind the Fountain of
Magical Brethren; the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold
gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells. There
were no more footsteps. She had stopped running. He crouched behind the statues, listening.
“Come out, come out, little Harry!” she called in her mock-baby voice,
which echoed off the polished wooden floors. “What did you come after me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!”
“I am!” shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry’s seemed to
chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room.
“Aaaaaah . . . did you love him, little baby Potter?”
Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before. He flung
himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed “Crucio!”
Bellatrix screamed. The spell had knocked her off her feet, but she
did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had — she was already
on her feet again, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again — her counterspell hit the head of the
handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away,
gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.
“Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she
yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean
them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain — to enjoy it —
righteous anger won’t hurt me for long — I’ll show you how it is
done, shall I? I’ll give you a lesson —”
Harry had been edging around the fountain on the other side. She
screamed, “Crucio!” and he was forced to duck down again as the cen-
taur’s arm, holding its bow, spun off and landed with a crash on the
floor a short distance from the golden wizard’s head.
“Potter, you cannot win against me!” she cried. He could hear her
moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him. He backed
around the statue away from her, crouching behind the centaur’s legs,
his head level with the house-elf’s. “I was and am the Dark Lord’s
most loyal servant, I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know
spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to
compete —”
“Stupefy!” yelled Harry. He had edged right around to where the
goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at
her back as she peered around the fountain for him. She reacted so fast
he barely had time to duck.
“Protego!”
The jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him.
Harry scrambled back behind the fountain, and one of the goblin’s
ears went flying across the room.
“Potter, I am going to give you one chance!” shouted Bellatrix.
“Give me the prophecy — roll it out toward me now — and I may
spare your life!”
“Well, you’re going to have to kill me, because it’s gone!” Harry
roared — and as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead. His
scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage. “And he knows!” said Harry with a mad
laugh to match Bellatrix’s own. “Your dear old mate Voldemort knows
it’s gone! He’s not going to be happy with you, is he?”
“What? What do you mean?” she cried, and for the first time there
was fear in her voice.
“The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the
steps! What do you think Voldemort’ll say about that, then?”
His scar seared and burned. . . . The pain of it was making his eyes
stream. . . .
“LIAR!” she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger
now. “YOU’VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT
TO ME — Accio Prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY !”
Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the
pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst.
He waved his empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and
withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him.
“Nothing there!” he shouted. “Nothing to summon! It smashed
and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that —”
“No!” she screamed. “It isn’t true, you’re lying — MASTER, I
TRIED, I TRIED — DO NOT PUNISH ME —”
“Don’t waste your breath!” yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against
the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. “He can’t hear you
from here!”
“Can’t I, Potter?” said a high, cold voice.
Harry opened his eyes.
Tall, thin, and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and
gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled eyes staring . . . Lord Voldemort had
appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who
stood frozen, quite unable to move.
“So you smashed my prophecy?” said Voldemort softly, staring at
Harry with those pitiless red eyes. “No, Bella, he is not lying. . . . I see
the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind. . . . Months
of preparation, months of effort . . . and my Death Eaters have let
Harry Potter thwart me again. . . .”
“Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus
Black!” sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort’s feet as
he paced slowly nearer. “Master, you should know —”
“Be quiet, Bella,” said Voldemort dangerously. “I shall deal with
you in a moment. Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic
to hear your sniveling apologies?”
“But Master — he is here — he is below —”
Voldemort paid no attention.
“I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,” he said quietly. “You
have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!”
Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist. His mind was
blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor.
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had
sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a
crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its
chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry.
“What — ?” said Voldemort, staring around. And then he
breathed, “Dumbledore!”
Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was
standing in front of the golden gates.
Voldemort raised his wand and sent another jet of green light at
Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak;
next second he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his
wand toward the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to
life too. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and
sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled
toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur
galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool.
The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the fight, as
Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.
“It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore
calmly. “The Aurors are on their way —”
“By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He
sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting
the security guards desk, which burst into flame.
Dumbledore flicked his own wand. The force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his stone
guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort
was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect
it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield,
though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly chilling
sound. . . .
“You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his
scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. “Above such brutality,
are you?”
“We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man,
Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had
happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. “Merely taking your life
would not satisfy me, I admit —”
“There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!” snarled
Voldemort.
“You are quite wrong,” said Dumbledore, still closing in upon
Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the
matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless. He wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless
guard kept shunting him backward toward the wall, blocking his
every attempt to get out from behind it. “Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been
your greatest weakness —”
Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This
time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore,
that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the
fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his
wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame
flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all.
For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery
rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold upon Voldemort
at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to
strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as
Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the
pool where so recently the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak
wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame
and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled, and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one, long, fluid movement — the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs
into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke;
the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of
molten glass —
For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling,
faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly
struggling to throw off the suffocating mass —
Then he was gone, and the water fell with a crash back into its
pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor.
“MASTER!” screamed Bellatrix.
Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to
run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed,
“Stay where you are, Harry!”
For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could
not see why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing
Bellatrix still trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes
croaking feebly on the floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was
pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature
with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his
body ended and the creature’s began. They were fused together,
bound by pain, and there was no escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his
agony he felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore. . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry
felt the creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy. . . .”
Let the pain stop, thought Harry. Let him kill us. . . . End it, Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .
And as Harry’s heart filled with emotion, the creature’s coils loosened, the pain was gone, Harry was lying facedown on the floor, his
glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood. . . .
And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than
there should have been: Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying at
the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, but which
now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He put them on and
raised his head an inch to find Dumbledore’s crooked nose inches
from his own.
“Are you all right, Harry?”
“Yes,” said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head
up properly. “Yeah, I’m — where’s Voldemort, where — who are all
these — what’s —”
The Atrium was full of people. The floor was reflecting emeraldgreen flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall,
and a stream of witches and wizards was emerging from them. As
Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward.
“He was there!” shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who
was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall,
where Bellatrix had lain trapped moments before. “I saw him, Mr.
Fudge, I swear, it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and
Disapparated!”
“I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!” gibbered Fudge, who
was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as
though he had just run miles. “Merlin’s beard — here — here! — in
the Ministry of Magic! — great heavens above — it doesn’t seem possible — my word — how can this be?”
“If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, apparently satisfied that Harry was all
right, and walking forward so that the newcomers realized he was
there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands, others simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and
Fudge jumped so much that his slipper-clad feet left the floor), “you
will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision
as to what to do with them.”
“Dumbledore!” gasped Fudge, apparently beside himself with
amazement. “You — here — I — I —”
He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him,
and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry,
“Seize him!”
“Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men — and win again!” said
Dumbledore in a thunderous voice. “But a few minutes ago you saw
proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a
year. Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong
men for twelve months, and it is time you listened to sense!”
“I — don’t — well —” blustered Fudge, looking around as though
hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do. When nobody
did, he said, “Very well — Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see . . . Dumbledore, you — you will need
to tell me exactly — the Fountain of Magical Brethren — what happened?” he added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor,
where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard, and centaur
now lay scattered.
“We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,”
said Dumbledore.
“Harry — Harry Potter?”
Fudge spun around and stared at Harry, who was still standing
against the wall beside the fallen statue that had been guarding him
during Dumbledore and Voldemort’s duel.
“He-here?” said Fudge. “Why — what’s all this about?”
“I shall explain everything,” repeated Dumbledore, “when Harry is
back at school.”
He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard’s head lay on the floor. He pointed his wand at it and muttered,
“Portus.” The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the
wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more.
“Now see here, Dumbledore!” said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked
up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. “You haven’t got
authorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in
front of the Minister of Magic, you — you —”
His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over
his half-moon spectacles.
“You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore. “You will tell your Aurors to stop searching
for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to
work. I will give you . . .” Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve
hands from his pocket and glanced at it, “half an hour of my time
tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to
return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of
course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the headmaster will find me.”
Fudge goggled worse than ever. His mouth was open and his round
face grew pinker under his rumpled gray hair.
“I — you —”
Dumbledore turned his back on him.
“Take this Portkey, Harry.”
He held out the golden head of the statue, and Harry placed his
hand upon it, past caring what he did next or where he went.
“I shall see you in half an hour,” said Dumbledore quietly. “One
. . . two . . . three . . .”
Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his
navel. The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the
Atrium, Fudge, and Dumbledore had all disappeared, and he was flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound. . . .

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - S E V E N
THE LOST PROPHEC Y

Harry’s feet hit solid ground again; his knees buckled a little
and the golden wizard’s head fell with a resounding clunk to
the floor. He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumbledore’s office.
Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmaster’s
absence. The delicate silver instruments stood again upon the spindlelegged tables, puffing and whirring serenely. The portraits of the
headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads
lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of their pictures. Harry
looked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along
the horizon: Dawn was approaching.
The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or
snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him. If his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures
would have been screaming in pain. He walked around the quiet,
beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think. But he had to
think. . . . There was no escape. . . .
It was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault. If he, Harry, had
not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort’s trick, if he had not
been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he
had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as
Hermione had said, banking on Harry’s love of playing the hero . . .
It was unbearable, he would not think about it, he could not stand
it. . . . There was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel
or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had vanished. He did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent
space, he could not stand it —
A picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and
a cool voice said, “Ah . . . Harry Potter . . .”
Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his arms as he
watched Harry with shrewd, narrow eyes.
“And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?” said
Phineas. “This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful
headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don’t tell me . . .”
He gave another shuddering yawn. “Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson?”
Harry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius
was dead, but Harry could not tell him. To say it aloud would be to
make it final, absolute, irretrievable.
A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob.
It would not turn. He was shut in.
“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who
hung on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk, “that Dumbledore will
soon be back with us?”
Harry turned. The wizard was eyeing him with great interest. Harry
nodded. He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back, but it
remained immovable.
“Oh good,” said the wizard. “It has been very dull without him,
very dull indeed.”
He settled himself on the thronelike chair on which he had been
painted and smiled benignly upon Harry.
“Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,” he
said comfortably. “Oh yes. Holds you in great esteem.”
The guilt filling the whole of Harry’s chest like some monstrous,
weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed. Harry could not stand
this, he could not stand being Harry anymore. . . . He had never felt
more trapped inside his own head and body, never wished so intensely
that he could be somebody — anybody — else. . . .
The empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making Harry
leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate.
As Dumbledore’s tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards
and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake. Many of them
gave cries of welcome.
“Thank you,” said Dumbledore softly.
He did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of his robes, the
tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom he placed gently on the tray of
soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood.
“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the
baby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events.”
Harry tried to say “Good,” but no sound came out. It seemed to
him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage
he had caused by his actions tonight, and although Dumbledore was
for once looking at him directly, and though his expression was kindly
rather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet his eyes.
“Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now,” said Dumbledore. “Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St.
Mungo’s, but it seems that she will make a full recovery.”
Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was
growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure that all the
portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been
and why there had been injuries.
“I know how you are feeling, Harry,” said Dumbledore very
quietly.
“No, you don’t,” said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and
strong. White-hot anger leapt inside him. Dumbledore knew nothing
about his feelings.
“You see, Dumbledore?” said Phineas Nigellus slyly. “Never try to
understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be
tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own —”
“That’s enough, Phineas,” said Dumbledore.
Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly
out of the opposite window. He could see the Quidditch stadium in
the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy
black dog, so he could watch Harry play. . . . He had probably come
to see whether Harry was as good as James had been. . . . Harry had
never asked him. . . .
“There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,” said Dumbledore’s voice. “On the contrary . . . the fact that you can feel pain like
this is your greatest strength.”
Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his
calmness and his empty words.
“My greatest strength, is it?” said Harry, his voice shaking as he
stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it. “You haven’t
got a clue. . . . You don’t know . . .”
“What don’t I know?” asked Dumbledore calmly.
It was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage.
“I don’t want to talk about how I feel, all right?”
“Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is
part of being human —”
“THEN — I — DON’T — WANT — TO — BE — HUMAN!”
Harry roared, and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from
the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room. It
shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the
pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando
Dippet said, “Really!”
“I DON’T CARE!” Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. “I’VE HAD ENOUGH,
I’VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I
DON’T CARE ANYMORE —”
He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and
threw that too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions.
“You do care,” said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a
single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was
calm, almost detached. “You care so much you feel as though you will
bleed to death with the pain of it.”
“I — DON’T!” Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat
might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and
break him too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make
him feel some tiny part of the horror inside Harry.
“Oh yes, you do,” said Dumbledore, still more calmly. “You have
now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent
you have ever known. Of course you care.”
“YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL!” Harry roared. “YOU —
STANDING THERE — YOU —”
But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more
help. He wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look
back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes
staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. He ran to the door, seized
the doorknob again, and wrenched at it.
But the door would not open.
Harry turned back to Dumbledore.
“Let me out,” he said. He was shaking from head to foot.
“No,” said Dumbledore simply.
For a few seconds they stared at each other.
“Let me out,” Harry said again.
“No,” Dumbledore repeated.
“If you don’t — if you keep me in here — if you don’t let me —”
“By all means continue destroying my possessions,” said Dumbledore serenely. “I daresay I have too many.”
He walked around his desk and sat down behind it, watching
Harry.
“Let me out,” Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore’s.
“Not until I have had my say,” said Dumbledore.
“Do you — do you think I want to — do you think I give a — I
DON’T CARE WHAT YOU’VE GOT TO SAY!” Harry roared. “I
don’t want to hear anything you’ve got to say!”
“You will,” said Dumbledore sadly. “Because you are not nearly as
angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know
you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.”
“What are you talking — ?”
“It is my fault that Sirius died,” said Dumbledore clearly. “Or I
should say almost entirely my fault — I will not be so arrogant as to
claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever, and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should
never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you
to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with
you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time
ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of
Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there
tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That
blame lies with me, and with me alone.”
Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but he was
unaware of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing.
“Please sit down,” said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a
request.
Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered
with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing Dumbledore’s desk.
“Am I to understand,” said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry’s
left, “that my great-great-grandson — the last of the Blacks — is
dead?”
“Yes, Phineas,” said Dumbledore.
“I don’t believe it,” said Phineas brusquely.
Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his
portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in
Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait,
calling for Sirius through the house. . . .
“Harry, I owe you an explanation,” said Dumbledore. “An explanation of an old man’s mistakes. For I see now that what I have done,
and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men
are guilty if they forget what it was to be young . . . and I seem to have
forgotten lately. . . .”
The sun was rising properly now. There was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and
bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his face.
“I guessed, fifteen years ago,” said Dumbledore, “when I saw the
scar upon your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might
be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.”
“You’ve told me this before, Professor,” said Harry bluntly. He did
not care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much
anymore.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore apologetically. “Yes, but you see — it is
necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after
you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar
was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else
feeling powerful emotion.”
“I know,” said Harry wearily.
“And this ability of yours — to detect Voldemort’s presence, even
when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since
Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.”
Harry did not bother to nod. He knew all of this already.
“More recently,” said Dumbledore, “I became concerned that
Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists. Sure
enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and
thoughts that he sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the
night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley.”
“Yeah, Snape told me,” Harry muttered.
“Professor Snape, Harry,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly. “But
did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why
I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked
at you for months?”
Harry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad
and tired.
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “Yeah, I wondered.”
“You see,” continued Dumbledore heavily “I believed it could not
be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind,
to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to
give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realized that
our relationship was — or had ever been — closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to
spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to
think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On
those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a
shadow of him stir behind your eyes. . . . I was trying, in distancing
myself from you, to protect you. An old man’s mistake . . .”
Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in
him, ready to strike, on those occasions when he and Dumbledore
made eye contact.
“Voldemort’s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight,
would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He
hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would
sacrifice you in the hope of killing him.”
He sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him. He
would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and
now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that
was the loss of Sirius, none of it mattered . . .
“Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very
night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack. I knew at
once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had
realized he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with
Professor Snape.”
He paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly
across the polished surface of Dumbledore’s desk, illuminate a silver
ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore’s explanation. He could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the
slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned. . . .
“Professor Snape discovered,” Dumbledore resumed, “that you had
been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for
months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of
hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body, and as he dwelled
on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant.
“And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of
Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all
along — that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily
protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the
shelves without suffering madness. In this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing
himself at last — or else you would have to take it for him. It became
a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.”
“But I didn’t,” muttered Harry. He said it aloud to try and ease the
dead weight of guilt inside him; a confession must surely relieve some
of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart. “I didn’t practice, I didn’t
bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione
kept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me
where to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t —”
Something was erupting inside Harry’s head: a need to justify himself, to explain —
“I tried to check he’d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge’s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and he said Sirius wasn’t there, he
said he’d gone!”
“Kreacher lied,” said Dumbledore calmly. “You are not his master,
he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher
intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.”
“He — he sent me on purpose?”
“Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one
master for months.”
“How?” said Harry blankly. “He hasn’t been out of Grimmauld
Place for years.”
“Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,” said
Dumbledore, “when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out.’
He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the
house. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had
any respect left. . . . Black’s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife
of Lucius Malfoy.”
“How do you know all this?” Harry said. His heart was beating very
fast. He felt sick. He remembered worrying about Kreacher’s odd
absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the
attic. . . .
“Kreacher told me last night,” said Dumbledore. “You see, when
you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realized that you
had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of
Mysteries. He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should
explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable
methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge’s office. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place.
“When, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest
with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still
believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort’s. He alerted certain
Order members at once.”
Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said, “Alastor Moody,
Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Remus Lupin were at
headquarters when he made contact. All agreed to go to your aid at
once. Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he
needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment. In the meantime he, Professor Snape, intended to search the forest for you.
“But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to
search for you. He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what
had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place/
shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told
me — laughing fit to burst — where Sirius had gone.”
“He was laughing?” said Harry in a hollow voice.
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret-Keeper for the Order, he could not
give the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Order’s confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. He was bound by
the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa
information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must
have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from
repeating it.”
“Like what?” said Harry.
“Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world
was you,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort
knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, that you knew
where he was — but Kreacher’s information made him realize that the
one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius
Black.”
Harry’s lips were cold and numb.
“So . . . when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night . . .”
“The Malfoys — undoubtedly on Voldemort’s instructions — had
told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you
had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to
check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to
pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire,
Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him.”
There seemed to be very little air in Harry’s lungs, his breathing was
quick and shallow.
“And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?” he croaked.
“He did not wish to tell me,” said Dumbledore. “But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied
to and I — persuaded him — to tell me the full story, before I left for
the Department of Mysteries.”
“And,” whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees,
“and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him —”
“She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I warned Sirius
when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that
Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him
that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think that Sirius
took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with
feelings as acute as a humans —”
“Don’t you blame — don’t you — talk — about Sirius like —”
Harry’s breath was constricted, he could not get the words out properly. But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again;
he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. “Kreacher’s a lying —
foul — he deserved —”
“Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as
your friend Dobby’s. He was forced to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no
true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher’s faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher’s lot easier —”
“DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!” Harry yelled.
He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who
had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much
he had suffered . . .
“What about Snape?” Harry spat. “You’re not talking about him,
are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me
as usual —”
“Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,” said
Dumbledore steadily, “but as I have explained, he informed the Order
as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced
where you had gone when you did not return from the forest. It was
he too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was
attempting to force you to tell of Sirius’s whereabouts. . . .”
Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape,
it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted
to hear Dumbledore agree with him.
“Snape — Snape g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house — he
made out Sirius was a coward —”
“Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble
taunts to hurt him,” said Dumbledore.
“Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!” Harry snarled.
“He threw me out of his office!”
“I am aware of it,” said Dumbledore heavily. “I have already said
that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was
sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than
to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my
presence —”
“Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with
him —” Harry remembered Ron’s thoughts on the subject and
plunged on. “How do you know he wasn’t trying to soften me up for
Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my —”
“I trust Severus Snape,” said Dumbledore simply. “But I forgot —
another old man’s mistake — that some wounds run too deep for the
healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about
your father — I was wrong.”
“But that’s okay, is it?” yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces
and disapproving mutterings of the portraits covering the walls. “It’s
okay for Snape to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate
Kreacher?”
“Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” said Dumbledore. “He regarded
him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference
and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . .
The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping
our reward.”
“SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?” Harry
yelled.
“I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,” Dumbledore
replied quietly. “Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves
in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living
reminder of the home Sirius had hated.”
“Yeah, he did hate it!” said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his
back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the
room now, and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked,
without realizing what he was doing, without seeing the office at all.
“You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that’s why
he wanted to get out last night —”
“I was trying to keep Sirius alive,” said Dumbledore quietly.
“People don’t like being locked up!” Harry said furiously, rounding
on him. “You did it to me all last summer —”
Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered
hands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften
him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was
showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when
Harry wanted to rage and storm at him.
Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his
half-moon glasses.
“It is time,” he said, “for me to tell you what I should have told you
five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at
me — to do whatever you like — when I have finished. I will not stop
you.”
Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the
chair opposite Dumbledore and waited. Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at
Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe
and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole.
You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and
uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”
He paused. Harry said nothing.
“You might ask — and with good reason — why it had to be so.
Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in? Many
would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and
delighted to raise you as a son.
“My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in
more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had
been vanquished hours before, but his supporters — and many of
them are almost as terrible as he — were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the
years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I
knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing
him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.
“I knew that Voldemort’s knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and
powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if
he ever returned to full power.
“But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my
decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which
he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore,
underestimated — to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact
that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection
he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I
put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her
sister, her only remaining relative.”
“She doesn’t love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn’t give a
damn —”
“But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have
taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took
you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your
mother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could
give you.”
“I still don’t —”
“While you can still call home the place where your mother’s blood
dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He
shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became
your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you
can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this.
I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her
doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept
you alive for the past fifteen years.”
“Wait,” said Harry. “Wait a moment.”
He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore.
“You sent that Howler. You told her to remember — it was your
voice —”
“I thought,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, “that she
might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of
having you as a surrogate son.”
“It did,” said Harry quietly. “Well — my uncle more than her. He
wanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she — she said I
had to stay.” He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, “But
what’s this got to do with . . .”
He could not say Sirius’s name.
“Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had
not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy
nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and
healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as
I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was
working well.
“And then . . . well, you will remember the events of your first year
at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the
challenge that faced you, and sooner — much sooner — than I had
anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort. You survived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and
strength. You fought a man’s fight. I was . . . prouder of you than I can
say.
“Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,” said Dumbledore. “An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan
should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin
it. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was
my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle
with Voldemort.”
“I don’t understand what you’re saying,” said Harry.
“Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing,
why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?”
Harry nodded.
“Ought I to have told you then?”
Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his heart was
racing again.
“You do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No . . . perhaps not. Well,
as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself,
was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when
you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young
age.
“I should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have
asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already
asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible
answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I
did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young,
much too young.
“And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again
you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced. Once again
you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me
again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark upon you. We discussed your scar, oh yes. . . . We came very, very close to the subject.
Why did I not tell you everything?
“Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than
eleven to receive such information. I allowed you to leave my presence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of
unease that I ought, perhaps, have told you then, it was swiftly silenced. You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in me
to spoil that night of triumph. . . .
“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now?
I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could
avoid, that I must avoid.”
“I don’t —”
“I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared
more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your
peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that
might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as
Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.
“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have —
and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined —
not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered.
What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you
were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have
such a person on my hands.
“We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled
to repel dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and rescued him. Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry?
But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young
you might be, but you had proved you were exceptional. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon. . . .
“But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric
Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself . . . and I did
not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do
it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the
knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved
that I should have placed the burden upon you before this. My only
defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens
than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could
not bring myself to add another — the greatest one of all.”
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.
“I still don’t understand.”
“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a
prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had
been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to
kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the
terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his
return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape
from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
 840 
its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously
since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.”
The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it.
The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided
gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry
had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the
baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes.
“The prophecy’s smashed,” Harry said blankly. “I was pulling
Neville up those benches in the — the room where the archway was,
and I ripped his robes and it fell. . . .”
“The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy
kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to
somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.”
“Who heard it?” asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already.
“I did,” said Dumbledore. “On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago,
in a room above the bar at the Hog’s Head Inn. I had gone there to see
an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against
my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all.
The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very
famous, very gifted Seer, and I thought it common politeness to meet
her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the
gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she
would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.”
Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes’s perch. He bent down, slid back a
catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with
runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve
upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew
silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand, and
deposited them in the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and

 841 
watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment.
Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.
A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the
basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her
use once before.
“THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD APPROACHES. . . . BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM, BORN
AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES . . . AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK
HIM AS HIS EQUAL, BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS
NOT . . . AND EITHER MUST DIE AT THE HAND OF THE OTHER FOR NEITHER CAN LIVE WHILE THE OTHER SURVIVES. . . . THE ONE WITH THE
POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD WILL BE BORN AS THE SEVENTH
MONTH DIES. . . .”
The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver
mass below and vanished.
The silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore
nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had
fallen silent.
“Professor Dumbledore?” Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore,
still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. “It . . .
did that mean . . . What did that mean?”
“It meant,” said Dumbledore, “that the person who has the only
chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end
of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents
who had already defied Voldemort three times.”
Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His
breathing seemed difficult again.
“It means — me?”
Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses.
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
 842 
“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have
meant you at all. Sibyll’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard
boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly
escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other
was Neville Longbottom.”
“But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and
not Neville’s?”
“The official record was relabeled after Voldemort’s attack on you
as a child,” said Dumbledore. “It seemed plain to the keeper of the
Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.”
“Then — it might not be me?” said Harry.
“I am afraid,” said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every
word cost him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it is you.”
“But you said — Neville was born at the end of July too — and his
mum and dad —”
“You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. . . . Voldemort himself would ‘mark him as his equal.’ And so he did, Harry. He
chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both
blessing and curse.”
“But he might have chosen wrong!” said Harry. “He might have
marked the wrong person!”
“He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,”
said Dumbledore. “And notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood
(which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being
or knowing), but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not
kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have
fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far — something
that neither your parents, nor Neville’s parents, ever achieved.”
“Why did he do it, then?” said Harry, who felt numb and cold.
“Why did he try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see
whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and
tried to kill whoever it was then —”
“That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,” said
Dumbledore, “except that Voldemort’s information about the
prophecy was incomplete. The Hog’s Head Inn, which Sibyll chose
for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting
clientele than the Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found
out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never
safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not
dreamed, when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney, that I would hear
anything worth overhearing. My — our — one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the
prophecy and thrown from the building.”
“So he only heard . . . ?”
“He heard only the first part, the part foretelling the birth of a boy
in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he
could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you — again marking you as his equal. So Voldemort
never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might
be wise to wait or to learn more. He did not know that you would
have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ —”
“But I don’t!” said Harry in a strangled voice. “I haven’t any powers
he hasn’t got, I couldn’t fight the way he did tonight, I can’t possess
people or — or kill them —”
“There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,” interrupted
Dumbledore, “that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that
is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human
intelligence, than forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power
held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which
Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight.
That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he
could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the
end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your
heart that saved you.”
Harry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius
would not have died. . . . More to stave off the moment when he
would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring
much about the answer, “The end of the prophecy . . . it was something about . . . ‘neither can live. . . .’ ”
“ ‘. . . while the other survives,’ ” said Dumbledore.
“So,” said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep
well of despair inside him, “so does that mean that . . . that one of us
has got to kill the other one . . . in the end?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore.
For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the
office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading
down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food,
who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone
forever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of
Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would
have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with
his laugh like a bark. . . .
“I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,” said Dumbledore
hesitantly. “You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you
as a prefect? I must confess . . . that I rather thought . . . you had
enough responsibility to be going on with.”
Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore’s face into his long silver beard.

C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - E I G H T
THE SECOND WAR BEGINS

HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED RETURNS
In a brief statement Friday night, Minister of Magic
Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-MustNot-Be Named has returned to this country and is
active once more.
“It is with great regret that I must confirm that the
wizard styling himself Lord — well, you know who I
mean — is alive and among us again,” said Fudge,
looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters.
“It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass
revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown
themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry’s employ. We believe that the dementors are currently taking direction from Lord — Thingy.
“We urge the magical population to remain vigilant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides to
elementary home and personal defense that will be
delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the
coming month.”
The Minister’s statement was met with dismay and
alarm from the Wizarding community, which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was “no truth whatsoever in these
persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating
amongst us once more.”
Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy, though it is believed that HeWho-Must-Not-Be-Named and a select band of
followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to
the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening.
Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster
of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, reinstated member of the International Confederation
of Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, was unavailable for comment last night. He
has insisted for a year that You-Know-Who was not
dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but recruiting followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize
power. Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived —
“There you are, Harry, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,”
said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him.
They were in the hospital wing. Harry was sitting on the end of
Ron’s bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front
page of the Sunday Prophet. Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in
a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione’s
bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size
and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had
dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was
reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a
word Hermione was saying.
“He’s ‘the Boy Who Lived’ again now, though, isn’t he?” said Ron
darkly. “Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?”
He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet, threw a few to Harry, Ginny, and
Neville, and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth. There
were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain’s tentacles had
wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could
leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had
started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly’s Oblivious Unction, there seemed to be some improvement.
“Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now, Harry,” said
Hermione, now scanning down the article. “ ‘A lone voice of truth . . .
perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story . . . forced to bear
ridicule and slander . . .’ Hmmm,” said Hermione, frowning, “I notice
they don’t mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing
and slandering, though. . . .”
She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs. The curse Dolohov
had used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he
been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in
Madam Pomfrey’s words, “quite enough damage to be going on with.”
Hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day
and although she was improving greatly, was already bored with the
hospital wing.
“ ‘You-Know-Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What
the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter, page nine . . .’ Well,” said Hermione, folding up the newspaper
and throwing it aside, “it’s certainly given them lots to write about.
And that interview with Harry isn’t exclusive, it’s the one that was in
The Quibbler months ago. . . .”
“Daddy sold it to them,” said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The
Quibbler. “He got a very good price for it too, so we’re going to go on
an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a
Crumple-Horned Snorkack.”
Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, then said,
“That sounds lovely.”
Ginny caught Harry’s eye and looked away quickly, grinning.
“So anyway,” said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, “what’s going on in school?”
“Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” said Ginny.
“He did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the
window and he’s roped it off —”
“Why?” said Hermione, looking startled.
“Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,” said Ginny,
shrugging.
“I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,” said Ron
through a mouthful of chocolate. “They sent me all these, you know,”
he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him.
“Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?”
Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, “So has all the
trouble stopped now Dumbledore’s back?”
“Yes,” said Neville, “everything’s settled right back down again.”
“I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?” asked Ron, propping a Chocolate
Frog card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug.
“Not at all,” said Ginny. “He’s really, really miserable, actually. . . .”
She lowered her voice to a whisper. “He keeps saying Umbridge was
the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts. . . .”
All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a
bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode
alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs. How he had
done it — how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor
Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him — nobody knew, and
Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her either. Her usually neat
mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it,
but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.
“Madam Pomfrey says she’s just in shock,” whispered Hermione.
“Sulking, more like,” said Ginny
“Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,” said Ron, and with his
tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright,
looking wildly around.
“Anything wrong, Professor?” called Madam Pomfrey, poking her
head around her office door.
“No . . . no . . .” said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows,
“no, I must have been dreaming. . . .”
Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.
“Speaking of centaurs,” said Hermione, when she had recovered a
little, “who’s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?”
“He’s got to,” said Harry, “the other centaurs won’t take him back,
will they?”
“It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,” said
Ginny.
“Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for
good,” said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. “Mind you,
the whole subjects useless if you ask me, Firenze isn’t a lot better. . . .”
“How can you say that?” Hermione demanded. “After we’ve just
found out that there are real prophecies?”
Harry’s heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione, or
anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them
it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death
Room, and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not
ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way. . . .
“It is a pity it broke,” said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.
“Yeah, it is,” said Ron. “Still, at least You-Know-Who never found
out what was in it either — where are you going?” he added, looking
both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.
“Er — Hagrid’s,” said Harry. “You know, he just got back and I
promised I’d go down and see him and tell him how you two are. . . .”
“Oh all right then,” said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. “Wish we could
come . . .”
“Say hello to him for us!” called Hermione, as Harry proceeded
down the ward. “And ask him what’s happening about . . . about his
little friend!”
Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory.
The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was
clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and
the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by studying or
homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering
out of windows as he went. He could see people messing around in
the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming
in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.
He was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted
to be with people or not. Whenever he was in company he wanted to
get away, and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought
he might really go and visit Hagrid, though; he had not talked to him
properly since he had returned. . . .
Harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall
when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right
that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry
stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. For a few moments, the
only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes drifting into the
hall from the grounds through the open front doors.
Malfoy glanced around. Harry knew he was checking for signs of
teachers. Then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice,
“You’re dead, Potter.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Funny,” he said, “you’d think I’d have
stopped walking around. . . .”
Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He felt a kind
of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted
with rage.
“You’re going to pay,” said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a
whisper. “I’m going to make you pay for what you’ve done to my
father. . . .”
“Well, I’m terrified now,” said Harry sarcastically. “I s’pose Lord
Voldemort’s just a warm-up act compared to you three — what’s the
matter?” he said, for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had all looked
stricken at the sound of the name. “He’s your dad’s mate, isn’t he? Not
scared of him, are you?”
“You think you’re such a big man, Potter,” said Malfoy, advancing
now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. “You wait. I’ll have you. You
can’t land my father in prison —”
“I thought I just had,” said Harry.
“The dementors have left Azkaban,” said Malfoy quietly. “Dad and
the others’ll be out in no time. . . .”
“Yeah, I expect they will,” said Harry. “Still, at least everyone
knows what scumbags they are now —”
Malfoy’s hand flew toward his wand, but Harry was too quick for
him. He had drawn his own wand before Malfoy’s fingers had even
entered the pocket of his robes.
“Potter!”
The voice rang across the entrance hall; Snape had emerged from the
staircase leading down to his office, and at the sight of him Harry felt a
great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt toward Malfoy. . . . Whatever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape . . . never . . .
“What are you doing, Potter?” said Snape coldly as ever, as he
strode over to the four of them.
“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,” said Harry
fiercely.
Snape stared at him.
“Put that wand away at once,” he said curtly. “Ten points from
Gryff —”
Snape looked toward the giant hourglasses on the walls and gave a
sneering smile.
“Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to —”
“Add some more?”
Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the
castle. She was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning
heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite
well.
“Professor McGonagall!” said Snape, striding forward. “Out of St.
Mungo’s, I see!”
“Yes, Professor Snape,” said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off
her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as new. You two — Crabbe —
Goyle —”
She beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling
their large feet and looking awkward.
“Here,” said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into
Crabbe’s chest and her cloak into Goyle’s, “take these up to my office
for me.”
They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase.
“Right then,” said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hourglasses on the wall, “well, I think Potter and his friends ought to have
fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-KnowWho! What say you, Professor Snape?”
“What?” snapped Snape, though Harry knew he had heard perfectly well. “Oh — well — I suppose . . .”
“So that’s fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom, and
Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell
down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor’s hourglass as she spoke.
“Oh — and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,” she added, and a
number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw’s glass. “Now, you wanted to
take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape — so there we
are. . . .”
A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable
amount below nevertheless.
“Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious
day like this,” Professor McGonagall continued briskly.
Harry did not need telling twice. He thrust his wand back inside
his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another
glance at Snape and Malfoy.
The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns
toward Hagrid’s cabin. Students lying around on the grass sunbathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet, and eating sweets
looked up at him as he passed. Some called out to him, or else
waved, clearly eager to show that they, like the Prophet, had decided
he was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of them. He
had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days
ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it
that way.
He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid’s cabin door that
he was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome. Hagrid, it
transpired, was picking runner beans in his back garden.
“All righ’, Harry!” he said, beaming, when Harry approached the
fence. “Come in, come in, we’ll have a cup o’ dandelion juice. . . .
“How’s things?” Hagrid asked him, as they settled down at his
wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice. “You — er — feelin’ all
righ’, are yeh?”
Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid’s face that he was
not referring to Harry’s physical well-being.
“I’m fine,” Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to discuss
the thing that he knew was in Hagrid’s mind. “So, where’ve you
been?”
“Bin hidin’ out in the mountains,” said Hagrid. “Up in a cave, like
Sirius did when he —”
Hagrid broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and
took a long draft of juice.
“Anyway, back now,” he said feebly.
“You — you look better,” said Harry, who was determined to keep
the conversation moving away from Sirius.
“Wha?” said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face.
“Oh — oh yeah. Well, Grawpy’s loads better behaved now, loads.
Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth.
He’s a good lad, really. . . . I’ve bin thinkin’ abou’ tryin’ ter find him a
lady friend, actually. . . .”
Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this
idea at once. The prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the
forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was positively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again,
and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large
gulps of his dandelion juice, half emptying his glass.
“Ev’ryone knows you’ve bin tellin’ the truth now, Harry,” said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly. “Tha’s gotta be better, hasn’ it?”
Harry shrugged.
“Look . . .” Hagrid leaned toward him across the table, “I knew
Sirius longer ’n you did. . . . He died in battle, an’ tha’s the way he’d’ve
wanted ter go —”
“He didn’t want to go at all!” said Harry angrily.
Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head.
“Nah, I don’ reckon he did,” he said quietly. “But still, Harry . . . he
was never one ter sit around at home an’ let other people do the fightin’.
He couldn’ have lived with himself if he hadn’ gone ter help —”
Harry leapt up again.
“I’ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,”
he said mechanically.
“Oh,” said Hagrid, looking rather upset. “Oh . . . all righ then,
Harry . . . Take care of yerself then, an’ drop back in if yeh’ve got a
mo. . . .”
“Yeah . . . right . . .”
Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open. He
was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walked away across the lawn. Once again, people called out
to him as he passed. He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing
they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself
alone in the grounds. . . .
A few days ago, before his exams had finished and he had seen the
vision Voldemort had planted in his mind, he would have given almost anything for the Wizarding world to know that he had been
telling the truth, for them to believe that Voldemort was back and
know that he was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however . . .
He walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared
out over the gleaming water, thinking. . . .
Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt
isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore. An invisible
barrier separated him from the rest of the world. He was — he had
always been — a marked man. It was just that he had never really understood what that meant. . . .
And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight
of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside,
he could not muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny and the
grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he
felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it
was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include,
or end in, murder. . . .
He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to
think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across
from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had collapsed trying to
fend off a hundred dementors. . . .
The sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold. He got up
and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days
before the end of term. Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk
about Sirius, but Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she
mentioned his name. Harry was not sure whether or not he wanted to
talk about his godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood. He
knew one thing, though: Unhappy as he felt at the moment, he would
greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days’ time when he was back at number four, Privet Drive. Even though he now understood exactly why
he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about
it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more.
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term.
It seemed that she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for
her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as
Fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises,
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
 857 
whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk.
Many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running
away down the path, and the Heads of Houses tried only halfheartedly to restrain their pupils. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back
into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and
was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick.
Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term feast, but
Harry had not even started.
“Just do it tomorrow!” said Ron, who was waiting by the door of
their dormitory. “Come on, I’m starving. . . .”
“I won’t be long. . . . Look, you go ahead. . . .”
But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was to
attend the end-of-term feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would
make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention
Voldemort’s return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all. . . .
Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his
trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly
wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it
was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his
trainers, and examined it.
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him
just inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. Use it if you need
me, all right?
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out
fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry
held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled
note from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other.
If you need to speak to me, just say my name
into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be
able to talk in yours. James and I used to use
them when we were in separate detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead
parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able
to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the
dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in
front of his face with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly,
“Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even
closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at
him through the fog were definitely his own.
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang
clearly through the room, “Sirius Black!”
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the
mirror was still, definitely, his own. . . .
Sirius didn’t have his mirror on him when he went through the archway, said a small voice in Harry’s head. That’s why it’s not working. . . .
Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror
back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a
whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him
again. . . .
Disappointment was burning in his throat. He got up and began
throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken
mirror —
But then an idea struck him. . . . A better idea than a mirror . . . A
much bigger, more important idea . . . How had he never thought of
it before — why had he never asked?
He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing. He hurtled across
the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the
corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him, “The feast is
about to start, you know, you’re cutting it very fine!”
But Harry had no intention of going to the feast . . .
How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you
didn’t need one, yet now . . .
He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either
alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his
Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the
feast . . .
But just as he had given up hope he saw it — a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor.
“Hey — hey Nick! NICK!”
The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de
Mimsy-Porpington.
“Good evening,” he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the
solid stone and smiling at Harry. “I am not the only one who is late,
then? Though,” he sighed, “in rather different senses, of course . . .”
“Nick, can I ask you something?”
A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick’s face as
he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little
straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only
when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.
“Er — now, Harry?” said Nick, looking discomforted. “Can’t it
wait until after the feast?”
“No — Nick — please,” said Harry, “I really need to talk to you.
Can we go in here?”
Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.
“Oh very well,” he said, looking resigned. “I can’t pretend I haven’t
been expecting it.”
Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through
the wall instead.
“Expecting what?” Harry asked, as he closed the door.
“You to come and find me,” said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds. “It happens, sometimes . . . when somebody has suffered a . . . loss.”
“Well,” said Harry, refusing to be deflected. “You were right,
I’ve — I’ve come to find you.”
Nick said nothing.
“It’s —” said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had
anticipated, “it’s just — you’re dead. But you’re still here, aren’t you?”
Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.
“That’s right, isn’t it?” Harry urged him. “You died, but I’m talking
to you. . . . You can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can’t you?”
“Yes,” said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, “I walk and talk, yes.”
“So, you came back, didn’t you?” said Harry urgently. “People can
come back, right? As ghosts. They don’t have to disappear completely.
Well?” he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.
Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, “Not everyone can come
back as a ghost.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
“Only . . . only wizards.”
“Oh,” said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. “Well, that’s
okay then, the person I’m asking about is a wizard. So he can come
back, right?”
Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at
Harry. “He won’t come back.”
“Who?”
“Sirius Black,” said Nick.
“But you did!” said Harry angrily. “You came back — you’re dead
and you didn’t disappear —”
“Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to
walk palely where their living selves once trod,” said Nick miserably.
“But very few wizards choose that path.”
“Why not?” said Harry. “Anyway — it doesn’t matter — Sirius
won’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!”
And so strong was his belief that Harry actually turned his head to
check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius,
pearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward
him.
“He will not come back,” repeated Nick quietly. “He will have . . .
gone on.”
“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” said Harry quickly. “Gone on
where? Listen — what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you
go? Why doesn’t everyone come back? Why isn’t this place full of
ghosts? Why — ?”
“I cannot answer,” said Nick.
“You’re dead, aren’t you?” said Harry exasperatedly. “Who can answer better than you?”
“I was afraid of death,” said Nick. “I chose to remain behind. I
sometimes wonder whether I oughtn’t to have . . . Well, that is neither
here nor there. . . . In fact, I am neither here nor there. . . .” He gave
a small sad chuckle. “I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for
I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards
study the matter in the Department of Mysteries —”
“Don’t talk to me about that place!” said Harry fiercely.
“I am sorry not to have been more help,” said Nick gently. “Well
. . . well, do excuse me . . . the feast, you know . . .”
And he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at
the wall through which Nick had disappeared.
Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again
in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once
more. He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty
castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again.
He had turned the corner toward the Fat Lady’s corridor when he
saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A second glance showed him that it was Luna. There were no good hiding
places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any
case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the
moment.
“Hello,” said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped
back from the notice.
“How come you’re not at the feast?” Harry asked.
“Well, I’ve lost most of my possessions,” said Luna serenely. “People take them and hide them, you know. But as it’s the last night, I really do need them back, so I’ve been putting up signs.”
She gestured toward the notice board, upon which, sure enough,
she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea
for their return.
An odd feeling rose in Harry — an emotion quite different from
the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius’s death. It was a few
moments before he realized that he was feeling sorry for Luna.
“How come people hide your stuff?” he asked her, frowning.
“Oh . . . well . . .” She shrugged. “I think they think I’m a bit odd,
you know. Some people call me ‘Loony’ Lovegood, actually.”
Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather
painfully.
“That’s no reason for them to take your things,” he said flatly.
“D’you want help finding them?”
“Oh no,” she said, smiling at him. “They’ll come back, they always
do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway . . .
why aren’t you at the feast?”
Harry shrugged. “Just didn’t feel like it.”
“No,” said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes. “I don’t suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed
was your godfather, wasn’t he? Ginny told me.”
Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not
mind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she too
could see thestrals.
“Have you . . .” he began. “I mean, who . . . has anyone you’ve
known ever died?”
“Yes,” said Luna simply, “my mother. She was a quite extraordinary
witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells
went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.
“Yes, it was rather horrible,” said Luna conversationally. “I still feel
very sad about it sometimes. But I’ve still got Dad. And anyway, it’s
not as though I’ll never see Mum again, is it?”
“Er — isn’t it?” said Harry uncertainly.
She shook her head in disbelief. “Oh, come on. You heard them,
just behind the veil, didn’t you?”
“You mean . . .”
“In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of
sight, that’s all. You heard them.”
They looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not
know what to say, or to think. Luna believed so many extraordinary
things . . . yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil
too. . . .
“Are you sure you don’t want me to help you look for your stuff?”
he said.
“Oh no,” said Luna. “No, I think I’ll just go down and have some
pudding and wait for it all to turn up. . . . It always does in the end.
. . . Well, have a nice holiday, Harry.”
“Yeah . . . yeah, you too.”
She walked away from him, and as he watched her go, he found that
the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.
The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in
several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who had clearly been
waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he
made his way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded
had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw
what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to
Harry’s aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan
Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot
had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had
taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much
as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry,
Ernie, and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them
there to ooze.
“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing Malfoy’s mother’s face
when he gets off the train,” said Ernie with some satisfaction, as he
watched Malfoy squirm above him. Ernie had never quite got over the
indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief
spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.
“Goyle’s mum’ll be really pleased, though,” said Ron, who had
come to investigate the source of the commotion. “He’s loads better-
looking now. . . . Anyway, Harry, the food trolley’s just stopped if you
want anything. . . .”
Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their
compartment, where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and
Pumpkin Pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again,
Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and Neville was stroking his
Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year
and now made odd crooning noises when touched.
Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard
chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet. It was now
full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that
the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very
morning. . . .
“It hasn’t really started yet,” sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up
the newspaper again. “But it won’t be long now. . . .”
“Hey, Harry,” said Ron, nodding toward the glass window onto the
corridor.
Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta
Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho’s eyes met for
a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down
at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its
square by Ron’s knight.
“What’s — er — going on with you and her anyway?” Ron asked
quietly.
“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully.
“I — er — heard she’s going out with someone else now,” said
Hermione tentatively.
Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at
all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no
longer quite connected with him. So much of what he had wanted
before Sirius’s death felt that way these days. . . . The week that had
elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much,
much longer: It stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in
it, and the one without.
“You’re well out of it, mate,” said Ron forcefully. “I mean, she’s
quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more
cheerful.”
“She’s probably cheerful enough with someone else,” said Harry,
shrugging.
“Who’s she with now anyway?” Ron asked Hermione, but it was
Ginny who answered.
“Michael Corner,” she said.
“Michael — but —” said Ron, craning around in his seat to stare
at her. “But you were going out with him!”
“Not anymore,” said Ginny resolutely. “He didn’t like Gryffindor
beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him
and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.” She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside down,
and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.
“Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,” he said, prodding
his queen forward toward Harry’s quivering castle. “Good for you.
Just choose someone — better — next time.”
He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.
“Well, I’ve chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he’s better?” asked
Ginny vaguely.
“WHAT?” shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks
went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered
and hooted angrily from overhead.
As the train slowed down in the approach to King’s Cross, Harry
thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained
stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would
take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill,
however, he lifted down Hedwig’s cage and prepared to drag his trunk
from the train as usual.
When the ticket inspector signaled to him, Ron, and Hermione
that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms
nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other
side: a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not
expected at all.
There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his
bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done
without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped
in a voluminous traveling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her
bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering
through the dirty glass station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans
and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend the weird sisters.
Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair graying, a long and
threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the
front of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new
jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.
“Ron, Ginny!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forward and hugging
her children tightly. “Oh, and Harry dear — how are you?”
“Fine,” lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her
shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins’ new clothes.
“What are they supposed to be?” he asked, pointing at the jackets.
“Finest dragon skin, little bro,” said Fred, giving his zip a little
tweak. “Business is booming and we thought we’d treat ourselves.”
“Hello, Harry,” said Lupin, as Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry and
turned to greet Hermione.
“Hi,” said Harry. “I didn’t expect . . . what are you all doing here?”
“Well,” said Lupin with a slight smile, “we thought we might have
a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you
home.”
“I dunno if that’s a good idea,” said Harry at once.
“Oh, I think it is,” growled Moody, who had limped a little closer.
“That’ll be them, will it, Potter?”
He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was
evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat.
Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked
positively appalled to see Harry’s reception committee.
“Ah, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley, turning from Hermione’s parents,
whom he had been greeting enthusiastically, and who were taking it in
turns to hug Hermione. “Well — shall we do it, then?”
“Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,” said Moody.
He and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station toward the
place where the Dursleys stood, apparently rooted to the floor.
Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the
group.
“Good afternoon,” said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon,
coming to a halt right in front of him. “You might remember me, my
name’s Arthur Weasley.”
As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys’ living room two years previously, Harry would have been very
surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle
Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but
chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were
outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and
embarrassed. She kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody
she knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed
to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly.
“We thought we’d just have a few words with you about Harry,”
said Mr. Weasley, still smiling.
“Yeah,” growled Moody. “About how he’s treated when he’s at your
place.”
Uncle Vernon’s mustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression
that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to
Moody.
“I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my
house —”
“I expect what you’re not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,” growled Moody.
“Anyway, that’s not the point,” interjected Tonks, whose pink hair
seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for
she closed her eyes rather than look at her. “The point is, if we find
out you’ve been horrible to Harry —”
“— and make no mistake, we’ll hear about it,” added Lupin
pleasantly.
“Yes,” said Mr. Weasley, “even if you won’t let Harry use the
fellytone —”
“Telephone,” whispered Hermione.
“Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter’s been mistreated in any way,
you’ll have us to answer to,” said Moody.
Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. His sense of outrage seemed to
outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs.
“Are you threatening me, sir?” he said, so loudly that passersby actually turned to stare.
“Yes, I am,” said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle
Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly.
“And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?”
barked Uncle Vernon.
“Well . . .” said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his
sinisterly revolving magical eye. Uncle Vernon leapt backward in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. “Yes, I’d have to say
you do, Dursley.”
He turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry. “So, Potter . . . give us a
shout if you need us. If we don’t hear from you for three days in a row,
we’ll send someone along. . . .”
Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer
that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught
sight of these people marching up the garden path.
“ ’Bye, then, Potter,” said Moody, grasping Harry’s shoulder for a
moment with a gnarled hand.
“Take care, Harry,” said Lupin quietly. “Keep in touch.”
“Harry, we’ll have you away from there as soon as we can,” Mrs.
Weasley whispered, hugging him again.
“We’ll see you soon, mate,” said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry’s
hand.
“Really soon, Harry,” said Hermione earnestly. “We promise.”
Harry nodded. He somehow could not find words to tell them
what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side. Instead
he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around, and led the way
out of the station toward the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt
Petunia, and Dudley hurrying along in his wake.
